246512,AMED,These 5 Low Leverage Stocks Are Safe Bets,opinion,Leverage refers to an investment strategy that involves borrowing of funds to expand business  purchase inventory and other assets as well as support other aspects of business operations  Financial leverage is the amount of debt that exists in the capital structure of a company Per the theory of cost of capital  a company s capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity used to finance capital projects  A comparative analysis of the same theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper  especially in periods of low interest rates This is because when a company resorts to debt financing  it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a specific time period However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s profits as well  So  debt financing valued by corporates Yet  debt financing is not always a welcome way  This is because companies with heavy debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt if things go downhill So  if a company is highly leveraged  in other words carries an exorbitant amount of debt  investors will not be willing to add the stock  A high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments  which affects the bottom line Nevertheless  this should not shift investor attention from U S  stocks since debt has been part of the economy since foundation and yet the country boasts the largest stock market in the world  What investors need to do is choose stocks with caution  avoiding those with high debt loads This is where the significance of financial leverage ratio comes into play as it measures the extent of financial leverage a company bears  To choose a corporation that is not so heavily indebted  several leverage ratios have been developed over the years  with the debt to equity ratio being the most popular Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company Now investors must be eyeing companies that exhibited solid earnings growth in the Q4 earnings season  But  in the uncertain world of investment  markets can falter  particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage  Therefore  investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth and not considering their debt level is not a wise move The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure steady returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectationZacks Rank  1 or 2  Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 46 stocks that made it through the screen RLI Corp    NYSE RLI    It is a specialty property casualty  P C  underwriter that caters primarily to niche markets  The company delivered average positive earnings surprise of 144 08  in the last four quarters and currently carries a Zacks Rank  2 Nextera Energy Inc    NYSE NEE    It is engaged in the

236010,STX,Stocks   Dow s Late Stage Rally Falls Short Amid Slump in U S  Job Gains,news,"Investing com   The Dow closed lower for a fifth straight day Friday as a late session rally proved too little too late following an earlier slide on data showing the U S  economy created fewer jobs than expected  adding to fears of a slowdown in global growth 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0 09  to close at 25 450 24 after recovering from a session low of 25 252 46  The S P 500 lost 0 21   while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0 18  
For the week  the Dow was off 2 2   its second weekly loss in a row  The S P 500 fell 2 15   The Nasdaq dropped 2 5   The Nasdaq s decline was its first after 10 straight weekly gains  The S P 500 snapped a five week winning streak 
The U S  Labor Department reported 20 000 jobs were created last month  well short of economists  estimates for around 181 000  raising fears the slowdown in global growth could be starting to make a dent on the U S  economy  But wage growth and the unemployment rate did offer some solace for investors and traders as both measures exceeded economists  estimates 
Analysts downplayed the report  saying weather related noise had weighed on job creation 
The slowing may reflect  some moderation  in the trend  but much of decline was likely caused by  weather effects   High Frequency Economics said   While the three month average of job gains is a still healthy 186 000  that is below what has been a 200K plus trend  
 The trend likely remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down over time   HFE added 
The slump in U S  job growth comes during a week in which signs of a slowdown in the global economy have been front and center 
China said Friday its exports slid the most in three years in February compared with a year earlier  A day earlier  the European Union launched a fresh stimulus measure to prop up lending after warning the slumber in euro area growth would likely continue into the current year 
Fears that oil demand growth could suffer in the wake of a wobble in the global economy  pressured U S  crude prices  sending energy stocks lower  Brent Oil Futures also fell 
In a sign of souring investor appetite on risk assets  defensive corners of the market were in favor as utilities  real estate and consumer staples ended the day higher 
Consumer staples were also boosted by a 5 1  surge in Costco Wholesale shares after the wholesale members club posted a fiscal second quarter profit that topped estimates from Investing com  The report prompted bullish calls from analysts on Wall Street 
RBC raised its price target on shares of Costco  NASDAQ COST  to  250 from  235 
Oppenheimer raised its price target on Costco s stock to  245 from  240  citing potential the retailer may declare a special dividend of as much as  10 that  could add more upside to the story as the year progresses  
In other corporate news  DowDuPont confirmed it would split into three separate companies   Dow  DuPont  NYSE DWDP  and Corteva Agriscience   starting April 1 
The new  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  should begin trading in early April followed later by the agricultural business  Corteva 
 Today s announcement marks a major milestone toward successfully separating Dow on April 1  to be followed by the expected separation of Corteva Agriscience from the new DuPont on June 1  that will bring about three independent companies  Ed Breen  chief executive officer of DowDuPont  said in a statement 
Dow will be an independent  publicly traded company that will list on the New York Stock Exchange on or about March 20 under the ticker symbol  DOW WI  and begin trading April 2 under the ticker symbol  DOW

381999,AMZN,Bleak Near Term Outlook For Air Freight   Cargo Stocks ,opinion,"The Zacks  industry includes players that provide air delivery and freight services  Most companies in the space focus on offering specialized transportation and logistics services 
Apart from operating a ground fleet of multiple vehicles  some of these companies maintain an air fleet  They offer air transportation services for passengers as well as cargo  Some companies also render their services to those entities that outsource air cargo lift requirements 
Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Driven by the advancement of relevant technologies  e commerce   the method of buying and selling goods and services via a software platform   continues to display phenomenal growth  This growth story is a huge positive for the sector participants   According to United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS   UPS   one of the key members of this industry  cross border e commerce volume will grow by 28  in the 2019 2021 period  The upbeat freight scenario is an added positive for the providers of air delivery and freight services  In fact  the Cass Freight Shipments Index has expanded on a year over year basis in each of the first 11 months of 2018  Additionally  a lower tax rate due to the current tax law will aid margin growth Recommendations from a task force appointed by President Trump suggested that the United States Postal Service   USPS   should raise the price for shipping packages  The move  apart from hurting online retailers may also hit the likes of UPS and FedEx  NYSE FDX   FDX  as these companies often use USPS for the last mile delivery  Furthermore  competition is likely to intensify in the space with Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   AMZN  looking to expand its logistics network  In November 2018  media reports suggested that Amazon was offering steep discounts for its pilot shipping program that is being currently tested  The discounts made Amazon s shipping service  launched last year  cheaper than those offered by the likes of UPS and FedEx Major industry players have significant exposure to China s economy  which is in doldrums  Moreover  the tariff war between the United States and China is not doing any good to the global economy either  Fears of a global trade slowdown were reflected in the bearish fiscal 2019 guidance provided by FedEx in December 2018  Moreover  with these companies investing significantly to upgrade their facilities following the surge in e commerce demand  their bottom lines are under pressure due to escalated capital expenditures  For instance  capital expenditure at UPS for full year 2018 is projected between  6 5 billion and  7 billion  The estimation reflects an increase in excess of 100  from the approximately  3 billion incurred by UPS toward capital expenditures in 2016 Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy Prospects
The six member Zacks air freight and cargo industry  housed within the broader Zacks  sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  216  This rank places it at the bottom 16  of more than 250 Zacks industries 
The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bleak near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry s rank has remained in the bottom half over the past several weeks 

The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Over the past six months  the industry s earnings estimate for 2019 has declined 3 9  
Despite the bleak near term prospects of the industry  we will present a few stocks that one can buy or retain given their growth prospects  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation first 
Industry Lags Sector   S P 500
The Zacks Airfreight   Cargo industry has lagged both the broader Transportation sector and the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year 
Over this period  the industry has declined 30 9  compared with the broader sector and the S P 500 index s depreciation of 18 3  and 6 7   respectively 
One Year Price Performance

 
Industry s Current Valuation
On the basis of the trailing 12 month EV to EBITDA  enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing transportation stocks  the industry is currently trading at 9 47X compared with the S P 500 s 10 07X  It is also below the sector s EV EBITDA ratio of 9 84X 
Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 12 83X  as low as 8 20X and at the median of 10 36X 
Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio 
 

 
Bottom Line
Even though the surge in online shopping is a positive for industry participants  we believe that players in the Zacks Transportation Air Freight and Cargo industry will struggle in the short term mainly due to increased capital expenses  possibility of global trade slowdown and issues related to the U S  China trade war  Moreover  technological failures like the TNT Express cyberattack at FedEx in 2017 have the potential to cripple operations 
Overall  the industry might not be able to tide over the challenges in the near term and therefore none of the stocks in the industry currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   However  below is a stock that has been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

430853,C,Xi and Trump Talked Trade  Korea Ahead of Chinese Aide s Visit,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed trade and North Korea in a phone call Tuesday  as Xi s top economic adviser plans additional talks in Washington following last week s trip by U S  officials to Beijing 
The two men discussed Xi s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and agreed on the importance of continuing sanctions on North Korea until it permanently dismantles its nuclear and missile programs  according to a statement from White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders 
Trump also affirmed his commitment to ensuring that the U S  and China have a balanced investment and trade relationship  the statement said 
The call followed Xi s meeting with the North Korean leader in the port city of Dalian over the past two days  the second meeting between top officials of the two Communist allies in less than two months  Kim told Xi that North Korea does not need nuclear weapons as long as security threats and hostility against the nation are eliminated  the official Xinhua News Agency reported  Kim had a summit with President Moon Jae in of South Korea late last month and is expected to meet with Trump  possibly next month 
On Monday in Washington  Trump was briefed by members of the U S  delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  who returned to Washington on the weekend from a two day visit to China 
Liu He will travel to Washington next week  Sanders said on Monday  Liu was recently promoted to vice premier and is Xi s top deputy on economic matters 
China s Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Ministry of Commerce and State Council Information Office didn t immediately respond to faxed requests for confirmation 
 The president has a great relationship with President Xi and we are working on something we think will be great for everybody   Sanders said in Washington   China s top economic adviser  the vice premier  will be coming here next week to continue the discussions with the president s economic team  We will keep you posted as the discussions are ongoing  
Mnuchin s delegation wrapped up two days of talks with Chinese economic officials on Friday with only an agreement to keep talking  Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on as much as  150 billion in Chinese goods  duties that can be imposed after a public comment period ends May 22 
Mnuchin will be part of a U S  delegation to Jerusalem on May 14 to open the new American embassy to Israel  but will return in time to meet with Liu  a Treasury spokesman said 
The two sides appear to be at loggerheads  with both making long lists of demands the other won t meet  analysts say  Trump wants China to cut its annual trade surplus with the U S  by at least  200 billion by the end of 2020 and refrain from retaliation against proposed U S  tariffs  China wants the U S  to stop an investigation into the country s acquisition of sensitive American technologies 
 The U S  has demanded too much  The upcoming visit is unlikely to yield a deal  but may make some progress   said Wang Yong  a professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University   Both sides have pressure as the implementation date of tariffs related to the 301 investigation draws near  
Liu told American business leaders while visiting Washington earlier this year that he d take steps to reform China s economy  according to a person familiar with the situation  Liu said at the time that he had three requests for the Trump administration  Establish a new economic dialogue  name a point person on China issues and hand over a specific list of demands  the person said 
 Last Thursday Friday s talk was too demanding and China probably won t accept all the lists as given  but there are a lot of places where both countries can talk more  for example in terms of market access  IP protection  trade practices and more importantly Made in China 2025   Liu Li gang  chief China economist at  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C    said in a Bloomberg Television interview from Hong Kong   In all these areas there s wiggle room for both sides to have some constructive talks

258774,SLB,US STOCKS Wall St hits 10 week low amid talk of new stimulus,news,"  U S  should plan for more fiscal stimulus  Obama adviser
   Oil futures settle down 1 8 pct  denting energy shares
   Indexes down  Dow 1 9 pct  S P 1 9 pct  Nasdaq 2 3 pct
  Updates to close 
 By Edward Krudy
 NEW YORK  July 7  Reuters    U S  stocks fell to their
lowest level in 10 weeks on Tuesday as talk of a second
government stimulus plan heightened fears that the economy is
not yet on the path to recovery and that the corporate earnings
season starting this week will be weak 
 A member of the Obama administration s economic advisory
panel said the United States should plan to possibly provide a
second round of stimulus funds to prop up the economy  The
comments come as investors question earlier optimism for a
quick recovery  which had driven stocks as much as 40 percent
higher since early March 
  It s clear that over the last three plus weeks that
investors are becoming concerned that the recovery in the
economy will not come as soon as expected and will not be as
strong as expected   said Hugh Johnson  chief investment
officer of Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany  New York 
  When there s talk about another stimulus plan that adds
fuel to that fire  it intensifies the concerns about the timing
and strength of the recovery  
 Cyclical stocks in the materials  energy  and industrial
sectors  which had ridden a recent upswing in raw material
prices on recovery hopes  led the market down as commodity
prices eased  Copper  a barometer of global economic strength 
fell nearly 2 percent 
 Caterpillar Inc  a maker of heavy machinery for
construction and mining companies  shed 4 5 percent to  30 29 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 161 27 points  or
1 94 percent  to 8 163 60  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index fell
17 69 points  or 1 97 percent  to 881 03  The Nasdaq Composite
Index lost 41 23 points  or 2 31 percent  to 1 746 17 
 The S P 500 closed at its lowest level since May 1 while
the Dow industrials closed at their lowest level since April
28 
 An initial snapshot of the second quarter performance of
natural resource companies will come on Wednesday when Alcoa
Inc kicks off quarterly earnings season  The aluminum producer 
a Dow component  is expected to post a third consecutive
quarterly loss 
 S P 500 corporate earnings are expected by analysts to have
declined about 36 percent from a year ago  according to data
compiled by Thomson Reuters  That would be roughly the same as
the decline seen in the first quarter 
 Doubts about the strength of an economic recovery and
subsequent demand for oil have sent crude prices tumbling in
the last week  New York crude fell 1 8 percent on Tuesday and
is down about 14 percent from the intraday peak hit on June 30 
Its slide has pressured energy stocks 
 Oil services company Schlumberger Ltd fell 4 4 percent to
 49 20 while blue chip Exxon Mobil Corp lost 2 3 percent to
 66 56  The S P energy sector index lost 2 5 percent 
 Non cyclical areas of the market  which have been stronger
in recent weeks as investors sought out companies better
positioned to weather a weak economy  initially withstood the
sell off on Tuesday  But by the end of the day even the
defensive sectors fell victim to selling 
 Health care  a classic defensive sector  traded in positive
territory for most of the day but by the close the S P
healthcare index fell 0 3 percent    still outperforming the
wider market 
 Drug maker Pfizer Inc  one of the few Dow stocks to finish
in positive territory  edged up 0 1 percent to  14 59 
 A rally in the broad S P 500 index that had boosted it
about 40 percent from 12 year lows hit in early March has
wilted in the last month as investors sought stronger evidence
that economic conditions were improving 
 Trading was below average on the New York Stock Exchange 
with about 1 11 billion shares changing hands  under last
year s estimated daily average of 1 49 billion  while on
Nasdaq  about 2 04 billion shares traded  below last year s
daily average of 2 28 billion 
 Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by
4 to 1 while decliners beat advancers on the Nasdaq by about 10
to 3

287557,AAPL,5 Hottest Tech ETFs Of 2017,opinion,"Technology sector has been the best performer among all S P sectors this year  rising 9 5  year to date and handily beating the 5 3  return posted by the broader S P 500 index  The sector also outperformed other asset classes from gold to real estate 
Tech companies did not participate in the initial post election rally as they were seen as exposed to the risks of trade wars and anti immigration stance  At the same time  they were expected to be the big beneficiaries of tax repatriation holiday promised by Trump    Read   
But this year  investors have dialed back expectations for a Trump bump  particularly after the failure of the Healthcare reforms  Financials  which had surged late last year on hopes of higher rates  deregulation and tax cuts  are lagging this year  with sector return less than 1  
Investors have now turned to companies that will be able to grow their earnings as the economic picture brightens  And with the global economy picking up momentum  technology companies appear best positioned to prosper  They are also less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation 
Further  this is expected to be a strong quarter for tech earnings growth with sector earnings expected to be up  10 7  from the same period last year  per Zacks Earnings Trends   Read   
Mega cap tech names like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL     have surged this year  driving the largest  ultra cheap  broad tech ETFs like the SPDR Technology Select Sector ETF    and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF     but the best performers this year are some of the lesser known ETFs that track the hottest technology trends  These are some of the disruptive technologies that will shape our futures

376727,UNP,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Union Pacific  Norfolk Southern  Canadian National Railway  Kansas City Southern And CSX,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Dec 8  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Railroads  Part 3  including Union Pacific Corp    NYSE UNP    Norfolk Southern Corp    NYSE NSC    Canadian National Railway   NYSE CNI    Kansas City Southern   NYSE KSU   and CSX Corp    NASDAQ CSX   Industry  Railroads  Part 3Link  Stocks in the railroad space are witnessing good times on the back of a number of tailwinds like an improved coal and intermodal scenario  financial prosperity and prudent cost management  among others  Despite the air of optimism  there are certain roadblocks one must be mindful of before investing in the sector  Let s delve into the details Declining Automotive VolumesWeakness in the automotive sector  due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States  has been hurting railroads for quite some time and the third quarter of 2017 was no exception  Results of major railroad operators like Union Pacific Corp  and Norfolk Southern Corp  were distorted due to softness in this key sector Automotive volumes declined 10  and 5  at Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific  respectively  in the third quarter of 2017  What is worse is that the situation on this front is unlikely to improve dramatically in the fourth quarter Union Pacific on its third quarter conference call said that light vehicle sales for full year 2017 are projected at 17 million units  reflecting a 3  decline from the 2016 levels  With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues  softness in automotive volumes in the fourth quarter will hurt them significantly Weather Related DisruptionsThe recent hurricanes hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines  Freight costs skyrocketed following the natural disasters  With fuel costs on the rise  the bottom line of these companies were hurt in the third quarter due to higher costs as a result of the hurricanes For instance  at Union Pacific  operating expenses increased 6  year over year to  3 4 billion in the third quarter  primarily due to Harvey  Furthermore  third quarter operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  deteriorated 70 basis points to 62 8  at Union Pacific  Operating ratio also deteriorated at the likes of Canadian National Railway in the third quarter due to high fuel costs Though operations have been normalized to a large extent  re occurrence of such violent acts of nature have the potential to hurt the bottom lines of railroads significantly by increasing costs  In fact  such acts of nature throw railroad schedules out of gear by rendering multiple miles of track out of service NAFTA UncertaintyUncertainty surrounding the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  is a major overhang on railroads  NAFTA refers to the trade pact inked in 1994 between the United States  Canada and Mexico in a bid to secure better terms for domestic workers  NAFTA has basically done away with almost all tariff among the three nations However  President Trump has repeatedly stated that he does not find the deal favorable to the United States  The President has called it     Trump has in fact threatened to   if the negotiations  which are currently in progress  fail to yield the desired results  Consequently  any unfavorable development on NAFTA has the potential to hit railroads like Kansas City Southern that have significant exposure to Mexico Kansas City Southern carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here Other HeadwindsService disruptions at CSX Corp   earlier in the year  battered the company  In fact  it had to attend a hearing of the U S  Surface Transportation Board in October  due to service issues  Company CEO Hunter Harrison  while apologizing to customers  attributed the disruptions to some of its employees resisting his attempts to boost earnings at CSX through cost cutting efforts  The company has already laid off more than 2 000 employees so far this year  The workforce at CSX is expected to be trimmed further by year end Naturally  Harrison s efforts at streamlining operations have met with resistance from employees  Though the company stated on the third quarter conference call that the issues are a thing a past  the occurrence of such customer related problems are unwelcome and should be avoided  Moreover  repealing the Clean Power Plan  CPP   aimed at benefiting the coal industry and therefore railroads  is a time consuming affair  Furthermore  even if CPP is repealed  as envisaged by President Trump  demand for coal might not pick up due to factors like cheap natural gas  according to many market watchers  In the event of the scenario materializing  railroads won t be benefited much  if at all  even if CPP is done away with Furthermore  proposals concerning reciprocal switching  referred to as forced access by the Association of American Railroads  if implemented  could result in significant loss of revenues for railroads  This is because the proposal pertaining to reciprocal switching would require railroads t0 share rail traffic with their competitors  most likely at below market rates ConclusionThe write up clearly indicates that stocks in the railroad space are not free from headwinds in spite of the optimism surrounding the space  The problems  unless solved quickly  can result in investors  especially the risk averse ones  shying away from the sector Check out our latest  for more news on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend looks

311729,NFLX,SPY  Quiet Right Up Until The End,opinion," Every noble work is at first impossible   Thomas Carlyle
A quiet  peaceful day with very low volume as we close out the end of 2015 until very late in the day when everything was hit  apparently on news the Prime Minister of Turkey said Iraq should use force again ISIS 
That s the only  reason  I can come up with anyhow 
We remain in chop with flashes of moves which quickly fade so I ll remain in cash until next week although we did try a very tiny option trade in Netflix Inc  O NFLX  today and took a small loss 
When I do something for the sake of doing something  most times it loses as it did today 
That is a small price to pay though 
I ve been cash for the past couple weeks after booking some nice gains on the short side and we re just sitting with all our cash waiting for setups to form 

N SPY backed off the resistance are as I mentioned here was likely last evening 
Massively low volume except the spike lower near days end is normal this time of year so there is no real need to sit in front of the computer tomorrow unless this weakness really takes off

350480,BIIB,New drug approvals fall to six year low in 2016,news,"By Ben Hirschler LONDON  Reuters    Last year turned out to be a disappointing one for new drug approvals with the U S  Food and Drug Administration clearing just 22 new medicines for sale  the lowest number since 2010 and sharply down on 2015 s tally of 45  Across the Atlantic  the European Medicines Agency recommended 81 new prescription products against a 2015 total of 93  Unlike the FDA  the EMA includes generic drugs in its list  The slowdown suggests the pharmaceuticals industry may be returning to more normal productivity levels after a spike in approvals in 2014 and 2015  when the haul of new drugs reaching the market hit a 19 year high  Several factors led to the fall in the approval rate in 2016  John Jenkins  the FDA s director of the office of new drugs  told a conference last month  Notably  five new drugs that had been scheduled for approval in 2016 ended up winning an early green light at the end of 2015  There was also a decline in drugs being filed for approval and the FDA rejected or delayed more applications in 2016 than in the previous two years  Some of the delayed drugs may yet go on to win approval in 2017  including Roche s multiple sclerosis treatment Ocrevus and Sanofi  PA SASY  and Regeneron s sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis  Most industry executives remain upbeat about the hunt for new medicines  given recent advances in fighting cancer and an improved understanding of the genetic basis of other diseases  which has resulted in full development pipelines at many firms  But it remains challenging to get new drugs through the approval process and to secure a decent financial return once they are launched  given resistance from healthcare insurers and governments to the rising cost of medical treatment  According to consultancy Deloitte  returns on research and development investment at the top 12 pharmaceutical companies fell to just 3 7 percent in 2016 from a high of 10 1 percent in 2010  Increasing political pressure over the high prices of many modern medicines is a growing challenge at a time when biotech and pharma companies are developing more drugs targeted at niche patient populations  The issue is exemplified by the last drug to win FDA approval in 2016  Spinraza  from Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  and Ionis Pharmaceuticals  is the first medicine to treat patients with spinal muscular atrophy  a rare and often fatal genetic disease  It comes at a huge cost of  125 000 per dose  That price  implying a total cost of  625 000 to  750 000 for patients in the first year and  375 000 in subsequent years  is likely to invite  a storm of criticism  up to and including Presidential tweets   according to Leerink analysts  President elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring down drug prices

415326,CVX,Here s How The Buy Side Expects Chevron To Report On Friday,opinion,"Chevron Corporation   CVX  is set to report FQ4 2013 earnings before the market opens on Friday  January 30th  Chevron is an American multinational energy company that is engaged in almost every level or the oil  natural gas  and geothermal energy industry  Earlier this month Chevron announced that it was working with Jefferies Group LLC to sell off several assets and reduce costs  CVX stock price has been down sharply over the past 3 4 weeks and revenue expectations from investors are far lower than Wall Street s  Here s how investors expect Chevron to report on Friday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the  platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

 
The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Chevron to report  2 58 EPS and  76 427B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 13 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  2 79 EPS and  69 618B revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Chevron to beat the Street s expectations on profit but come up short on revenue 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a large differential between the 2 groups forecasts  especially on revenue 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate in forecasting profit and revenue 4 times each  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69 5  more accurate than Wall Street  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by an independent  from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus  
The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  2 56 to  3 00 EPS and  64 350B to  76 627B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a large distribution of estimates for Chevron 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A larger distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market  which could mean more volatility post earnings  
Throughout the quarter analysts have downgraded their EPS expectations and increased their revenue forecasts  Wall Street lowered its EPS expectation from  3 11 to  2 58 while the Estimize consensus fell from  3 03 to  2 79  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and we are seeing the two groups revise their expectations in similar directions going into the report 
The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is Gordon who projects  2 92 EPS and  70 000B in revenue  In the Winter 2014 season Gordon rated as the 113th best analyst and is ranked 55th overall among over 3 700 contributing analysts  This quarter Gordon agrees with the Estimize community that Chevron will beat Wall Street s expectations on profit but come up short on revenue 
This quarter analysts on the Estimize com platform are expecting CVX to miss Wall Street expectations on revenue  but exceed on EPS  Chevron is making the right decision to sell of under performing assets and focus on long term growth  however  analysts expect quarterly revenue to fall short of the Wall Street consensus on Friday

421530,EXC,Exelon  EXC  Q1 Earnings Match Estimates,opinion,"Exelon  EXC  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 87 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  0 96 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this energy company would post earnings of  0 58 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 58  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Exelon  which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  posted revenues of  9 48 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 88   This compares to year ago revenues of  9 69 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Exelon shares have added about 11 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 6  
What s Next for Exelon 
While Exelon has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Exelon was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 68 on  7 66 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 14 on  32 67 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Utility   Electric Power is currently in the bottom 41  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/exelon-exc-q1-earnings-match-estimates-200415454,200415454

319239,AA,GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD Big tests lined up for investors,news,"By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  April 8  Reuters    The second quarter has started
with a bang as equities  commodities and other riskier assets
have soared  Now come some big tests 
 First  U S  companies begin a new earnings reporting season
in the coming week and investors will be watching to see not
just how the companies have done    probably pretty well    but
how things might shape up in the quarters to come 
 That is not nearly as clear 
 Second  the International Monetary Fund World Bank spring
meeting should provide a steady stream of updates on the real
strength of the world economy  its inflationary pressures and
general financial stability 
  One key for investors  a week after the European Central
Bank raised interest rates  will be to glean how much things
have  normalised   prompting more policymakers to accelerate the
removal of cheap money 
 For the time being  however  financial markets are embracing
risky assets with something akin to passion 
 World stocks as measured by MSCI hit a fresh 33 month high
on Friday  riding out worries ranging from Japan s costly
earthquake and Portugal seeking a debt bailout to the threat of
the budget less U S  government shutting down 
 Emerging market stocks  laggards for much of the first
quarter  have been particularly hot  rising as much as 11 6
percent from a March 17 low 
 Some of this has been due to increasing investor confidence
that growth and inflationary pressure in key emerging economies
such as China are being controlled  as exemplified by China s
rate hike during the past week 
 A test of this will come on Friday  when Chinese first
quarter GDP and inflation numbers are due 
  We expect Chinese GDP growth to weaken over the course of
the year  staging a soft landing   private bank Sarasin said in
a note   But there is a long way to go  
 
 PEAKING 
 MSCI s all country world stock index has actually risen 103
percent since its financial crisis low in March 2009    partly
prompted by a string of sterling corporate earnings seasons 
 The question now is whether these are about to peak 
 The latest season kicks of in the United States in the
coming week with a test of three key sectors    industrial
production from aluminium giant ALCOA  financials from
investment bank JPMorgan Chase and internet bellwether Google 
 Overall  the U S  reporting season is expected to be
reasonable  Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research projects first
quarter earnings to have risen 11 5 percent year on year 
 This compares  however  to a 37 2 percent increase in the
fourth quarter of last year 
 Some investors  indeed  are beginning to suggest that the
days of robust earnings growth will soon come to an end 
  The year on year increase now is going to decline into
single digits   said Giorgio Radaelli  chief strategist at
wealth manager BSI 
 In a similar vein  UK private bank Coutts told its clients
in the past week that U S  profit margins may have reached their
peak 
 It is looking for a squeeze from rising input costs  The
price of Brent crude oil  as one example  has risen more than 30
percent so far this year 
 
 IMF WORLD BANK
 The price of oil and other commodities  meanwhile  have
begin to worry central banks    epitomised by the ECB s hike in
the past week  its first since 2008 
 The IMF World Bank spring meeting should provide updates  as
will a G20 fringe meeting of finance ministers and a summit of
leaders from Brazil  Russia  India and China  in China 
 Investors will be looking for any sign that world monetary
policy    both the quantitative easing money printing from the
developed world and the unorthodox quantitative tightening
credit curbs designed as a response in many emerging economies
   needs to normalise and tighten up from here 
 The risk markets recovery of the last two years has been
fuelled by abundant liquidity 
 If that is to dry up  investors will need to be confident
that the world is  normal  enough for things to continue

264554,BAC,Earnings Watch  Let The Games Begin,opinion,"The season starts off slowly this week with Alcoa  NYSE AA  reporting  and a handful of other names in the Industrial and banking sectors 




Alcoa Inc  NYSE AA 
Materials   Metals   Mining   Reports April 11  after the close 
The first quarter 2016 earnings season unofficially kicks off after tomorrow s closing bell when Alcoa reports  After a dismal 2015 in which share prices plunged nearly 40   things have been improving slightly year to date  Even so  the aluminum company is poised for another disappointing quarter as they begin to shift resources to a corporate restructure  The Estimize community expects EPS of  0 03  a penny higher than the Wall Street consensus  and revenues of  5 276 B  in line with the Street  This projects the third consecutive quarter of growth declines for both metrics  with profits expected to fall 89  and sales by 9  

What to watch  At the moment  the state of aluminum industry is at the mercy of China which accounts for a majority of metals production and exports in the world  Alcoa has fallen victim to economic headwinds in China and is unfortunately expected to close the biggest active aluminum smelter in the U S  That said  Alcoa is planning to split itself up into two companies to preserve the profitability of its value adding operations  After years of building up its value added and upstream operations  Alcoa believes the two have the strength to run as stand alone entities  The upstream component will continue to produce materials like aluminum while the value added piece will continue to make things that use upstream materials like engine parts  By eliminating vertical integration  the value added business will benefit from cheaper metals elsewhere 
CSX Corp   NASDAQ CSX 
Industrials   Road   Rail   Reports April 12  after the close 
The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  0 39  just two cents higher than the Street  Revenues of  2 708B are actually below the sell side estimate of  2 732B  indicating a 10  drop in sales YoY  and the fourth consecutive quarterly decline 

What to watch  All eyes will be on cyclical names such as CSX this reporting season  mainly because the transportation sector is seen as a leading economic indicator  We already know that industrial conditions are not pretty  judging by an ISM reading that has stayed below 50 for four of the last five months  Expectations for CSX appear to confirm this weakness  with both EPS and sales growth estimated to decline on a year over year basis  Lower U S  coal production is having a negative impact as it is an important end market and revenue generating commodity for the railroad names  Like many other multinational companies  the strong US dollar will continue to take it s toll on the top line  as will low oil prices in the form of lower revenues from fuel surcharges 
JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM 
Financials   Diversified Financial Services   Reports April 13  before the open 
Chase kicks things off for banks this earnings season when they report first quarter earnings this Wednesday  This quarter  the Estimize community is expecting JPM to make modest revenue gains  The consensus data is calling earnings per share of  1 36 on  24 5 billion in revenue  almost 10 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  600 greater on the top  However  our Select Consensus  a weighted averaged of our most accurate analysts and recent estimates  is expecting a more modest beat of 6 cents on earnings and  330M on sales  This number has been falling lately  with per share estimates cut by 14  in the past three months  By comparison  earnings are projected to decline 6  on a year over year basis 

What to watch  The bank is coming off a better than expected fourth quarter where it beat on both the top and bottom line by a wide margin  This marked the third quarter Chase topped expectations in fiscal 2015  Unfortunately  shares haven t tracked earnings and are now down 4 16  in the past 12 months  Following the lead of the Federal Reserve  banks have decided to increase lending rates  Granted this has been a slow process  Chase is expected to see net interest income rise by about  2 billion for fiscal 2016  Moreover  total loan growth has been very strong and is expected to be a large revenue driver  This should help offset the losses in its trading and energy divisions  Trading is tracking negative year over year growth on the lows in the energy market  JPM expects to build up reserves in excess of  750 million to cover its energy loans  Chase also faces ongoing threats of litigation which resulted in over  100 million in losses last quarter  On the bright side  the modest gains the market has made in the past month have put the banks in a better position 
Bank of America  NYSE BAC 
Financials   Diversified Financial Services   Reports April 14  before the open 
For Bank of America  the Estimize community is expecting per share earnings of  0 25  two cents higher than Wall Street  on  20 87 billion in revenue  about  28M ahead of the sell side  Estimates have been feverishly cut ahead of its earnings  falling 18  in the past 3 months  That said  BofA is still projecting favorable year over year growth of 4  on the bottom line 

What to watch  Bank of America might be in the worst position of the retail banks  The stock has been in a tailspin lately  falling 22 9  since the start of the year  Even though the bank topped its earnings expectations in Q4  they managed to miss revenue expectations by approximately  500 million  This is a troubling trend that is anticipated to continue as BofA has forecasted further weakness in its trading and investment banking revenues  Projected year over year declines in these segments outpace the losses of its peers  Meanwhile  a deteriorating energy sector  along with Bank of America s volatile net interest income  increased expenses and larger capital deployment will all hamper earnings this quarter 
Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL 
Industrials   Airlines   Reports April 14  before the open 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  1 30  1 cent above Wall Street  with revenue expectations of  9 27 billion  about  35 million above the Street  However  our Select Consensus  a weighted average of our historically most accurate analysts and recent estimates  is expecting a more modest beat of  25 million on the top line  The Estimize community is optimistic in regards to Delta s profitability  raising its EPS estimate 12  in the past 3 months  Compared to the same period last year this represents a projected 188  on the bottom line  It s not surprising that Delta often tops expectations  beating Estimize in 56  of report quarters 

What to Watch  Delta was one of of the top performing U S  airlines in 2015  despite mixed earnings in the past 2 years  Last quarter  Delta reported better than expected results on the bottom line but missed its sales target  consistent with a year long trend of falling short on the top line  Revenue has clearly been the airline s biggest problem  continually coming in flat or negative on a year over year basis  Choppy domestic pricing on top of weaker business travel trends had a material impact on results in fiscal 2015  Moreover  key metrics including PRASM  passenger revenue per available seat mile  continue to fall short of expectations  This past week Delta announced that PRASM would be on the lower end of its guidance  likely falling  4 5  in the first quarter  Most international airlines have seen significant demand headwinds due to currency fluctuations and the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels  Still  share prices for DAL have remained strong and are up 11 95  in the last 12 months  Throughout this volatility  Delta has maintained a sound balance sheet  reducing its net debt to  6 7 billion from  15 billion at the end of 2015  This has helped drive strong free cash flow and is expected to continue as air travel demand is likely to improve  For the remainder of 2016  revenue is projected to grow 1  on a 2 to 4  capacity increase ",2016-04-11,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-this-week-4-11:-aa,-csx,-jpm,-bac,-dal-200124692",200124692

313943,GE,LEDs Light The Way For Some Rare Earth Metals,opinion,A glut of manufacturing capacity and near collapse in rare earth metal prices is driving down the cost and hence encouraging the rapid take up of light emitting diode  LED  lighting  LED lights are based on semiconductors and therefore do not require traditional lamp manufacturing expertise  This has opened opportunities for LED chipmakers to challenge the incumbent incandescent light bulb manufacturers such as Philips  Osram and General Electric  GE   who have enjoyed a near monopoly of the market according to an FT   The Financial Times believes LED technology is reaching a tipping point  particularly for the commercial sector  as price declines bring forward the payback time on the initial cost of investment  According to McKinsey  quoted in the article  LEDs are set to account for 41 percent of the overall value of the lighting market in 2016 and 63 percent by 2020  versus 12 percent last year  Lighting is one of those facets of modern life that we rather take for granted  but it is a huge consumer of electricity and LED lights consume a fraction compared to traditional incandescent lights or even fluorescent lights  which are themselves capable of up to 75  savings in power over incandescent  Lighting accounts for 19 percent of global electricity consumption  so changes that slash the energy consumption of the sector could have a significant impact on electricity demand  One factor holding back earlier adoption has been price  Although LED lights can last up to 50 times longer than an incandescent bulb  upfront costs have been prohibitive  so far  As production capacity rapidly rises and the rare earth metals yttrium  europium and terbium have fallen in price  the cost of manufacture has come down  speeding uptake  According to Tasman Metals  a mining company in the sector  LEDs present many advantages over both incandescent and compact fluorescent light sources  including lower energy consumption  longer life  improved robustness  smaller size  faster switching  and greater durability and reliability  Rare Earth Phosphor based LEDs have an expected life of 50 000 hours and some are sold with five year warranties  but so far the capital cost has inhibited uptake as quickly as the industry hoped  But overcapacity is forcing manufacturers to drop prices and raw materials  in the form of rare earth elements  have dropped to a third of where they were a year ago  according to the MetalMiner IndX   The unique combination of rare earths and semiconductor technology is also opening up the possibility for lighting  at least LED lighting  to mimic sunlight and colored tones rather than the harsher tones of conventional bulbs  which in turn opens up possibilities for lighting to be so much more than just a utility service  Lighting manufacturers may be going through a competitive period of re adjustment  but REE demand will benefit from the growth of an industry with plenty of potential  By Stuart Burns,2012-12-22,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/leds-light-the-way-for-some-rare-earth-metals-148504,148504
316894,PGR,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Progressive  PGR  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Progressive in Focus
Progressive  PGR  is headquartered in Mayfield Village  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 20 14  since the start of the year  The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of  2 51 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 47   This compares to the Insurance   Property and Casualty industry s yield of 1 62  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 93  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 51 is up 123 1  from last year  Progressive has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 17 12   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Progressive s current payout ratio is 25   This means it paid out 25  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
PGR is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 05 per share  with earnings expected to increase 14 25  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that PGR is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  ",2019-02-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-progressive-pgr-could-be-a-great-choice-200390786,200390786

428612,JPM,The Pound Is Now the Most Volatile Currency in the G 10,news," Bloomberg     The pound is buckling under concerns about Brexit  and the Bank of England may add further pressure to the currency when it meets this week 
The cost of insuring against undue volatility in sterling over a three month period has climbed to the highest among the Group of 10 exchange rates as the U K  steps up preparations for a no deal Brexit  The central bank is expected to signal that it is unlikely to raise interest rates in coming months  removing any support for the currency 
Money markets are  in fact  pricing a more than 60  chance of a 25 basis point rate cut by December on concern the U K  may exit the European Union without a divorce deal  That compares with just 20  in June  shortly after the central bank bucked global trends and cited the need to raise rates in coming years 
 With Boris Johnson now installed as PM  the Brexit saga is set to recommence   strategists at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   including Meera Chandan  wrote in a client note   The BOE s shift toward a neutral bias    all but giving up hopes for continued normalization    will do little to support  the currency 
JPMorgan sees policy makers lowering their growth outlook while moving further away from raising rates when they announce their decision and release their quarterly inflation report on Thursday 
The pound fell as much as 1 4  to  1 2212 Monday  its weakest level since March 2017  Three month risk reversals for the pair slipped to 177 basis points in favor of selling sterling  the most bearish since April 
Gilts  meanwhile  are headed for a third monthly rally and strategists foresee the gains extending  The yield on 10 year government bonds has fallen 18 basis points to 0 66  this month  and could fall below 0 50  in the event of a no deal Brexit  according to Petr Krpata  the chief EMEA currency and rates strategist at ING Bank NV 
 The more Brexit uncertainty there is  and more it spills over negatively in the growth outlook  the more downward pressure on U K  yields there will be   Krpata said   If early election weighs on sterling  as we expect  then U K  rates and yields will go lower due to the mix of flight to safety and the Brexit uncertainty  ",2019-07-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-pound-is-now-the-most-volatile-currency-in-the-g10-1938420,1938420
412268,PM,New Zealand Proceeds With Plain Cigarette Packaging Plans,opinion,Tobacco makers faced yet another jolt after companies in New Zealand were asked to remove logos from cigarette packets and also enlarge the health warnings posted on the their packages Under the regulation  still in the draft stage  cigarette packages should be plain with graphic warnings covering at least 75  of each side of the pack The law is expected to be passed in 2016 and enforced by early next year Not only that  the government of New Zealand has recently announced a tax hike for cigarette makers  This is expected to raise the price of a cigarette pack to about 30 New Zealand dollars   20   one of the highest in the world New Zealand expects to eliminate smoking by 2025 and  is working towards it for long  In 2013  the company first announced plans to pass a law regarding the use of plain packaging of cigarettes by tobacco companies  In 2012  the Australian government was the first to propose plain packaging The ruling was enforced by The World Health Organization which had pleaded that countries consider the plain packaging norm The move was vehemently opposed by tobacco sellers like Philip Morris International Inc   NYSE PM   and British American Tobacco  LON BATS  Plc    NYSE BTI   as these companies rely on packaging to build their brand and draw consumer attention  Packaging was the last resort for advertising after the government put a ban on tobacco advertising by placing ads in magazines  billboards and TV Tobacco companies have been penalized for taking recourse to any kind of advertising or packaging that flouts the laws  to boost sales  The global tobacco industry has been facing severe advertising and packaging restrictions on their products for some time Meanwhile  governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco makers which  in turn  are lowering cigarette consumption and affecting margins  The U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking A regulatory warning issued by the FDA in Aug 2015 against four of R J  Reynolds   a subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc    NYSE RAI    cigarettes forced the company to stop sales and halt further distribution  marketing and promotion of the products Moreover  the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act  which essentially states that menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health  Moreover  this ban will create a serious black market for these products  which would be detrimental to all tobacco companies Further  the Indian government has imposed plain packaging rules on tobacco makers who are required to cover 85  of the cigarette packets with pictorial warnings The regulatory authorities have imposed marketing and product regulations on e cigarettes as well  Also  there is not much scientific evidence to back their ability to help smokers quit or smoke less  Putting such a regulation into effect is expected to impact the e cigarette business and the top line of the tobacco companies in the coming quarters ,2016-05-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/new-zealand-proceeds-with-plain-cigarette-packaging-plans-200133190,200133190

349841,GOOGL,Crude Prices Decline  USD Vulnerable Ahead Of Trade Talks,opinion,"US stocks are back in style and riding momentum from fresh queues that the economy is doing well  Friday s better than expected US first quarter GDP reading of 3 2  was mainly supported on strong trade and inventory data  but the key takeaway remains the underlying economy is well and is not nearing a recession anytime soon  The dollar last week rallied strong on the better than expected economic data and robust demand for US equities 
USD   Trade talks and FOMC meeting begins on Tuesday
EUR   Spanish polls see Socialist Majority with Catalan Moderates
Volatility   VIX short bets rise to highest on record
Stocks   Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  reports after the close
Oil   Putin  No news that anyone wants to exit production cut agreements
Gold   Needs dovish Fed to stave off sellers
USD
The dollar could be vulnerable ahead of a big week that includes another round of trade talks and the May 1st FOMC rate decision  The Fed probably wants this meeting to be a non event and it could be if they stick to the script  The US economy is performing better than what most Fed officials thought and they may need to acknowledge the slowdown was temporary  They may choose to focus on low inflation and the possibility of easing  and that alone would help drive the dollar lower  If they are much more optimistic on the economy and see an eventual upturn for inflation  we could see the dollar resume on marching higher  The base case is for the Fed to remain patient on the data and concerned on inflation  If that is the case  we could see high beta currencies rally against the greenback 
On Tuesday  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and US Trade Representative Lighthizer return to Beijing for another round of talks that will focus on intellectual property  forced technology transfer  non tariff barriers  agriculture  services  purchases and enforcement  President Xi delivered many assurances with his speech at the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing  If President Trump signals to his team he is content with the latest concessions  we could see a final meeting setup later in May 

EUR
Euro opened slightly positive in early Asia Pacific trade after Spain s incumbent Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez appeared set to win the general election and could form a government with Catalan support  This election appears to be positive for the euro and for stability for Spain s economy  The euro also received some support from S P s decision to keep Italy s sovereign rating at BBB  which is just two notches in the investment grade territory  They did keep the outlook at negative  but that was expected  Italy should see some relief in the bond market on Monday 

VIX
 The latest CFTC numbers show big bets were short the VIX by about 178 000 future contracts  the largest amount since they kept records in 2004  While the VIX posted a gain last week  it remains in a downward trend and is currently 30  lower than the average over the last 20 years  Short VIX bets could be ripe for a short squeeze here  but the overall macro drivers do appear poised to support the downward move 
Stocks
Google parent company Alphabet Inc  reports after the close  Expectations are for earnings per share to fall after taking a  1 7 billion antitrust fine from the EU  Revenues are expected to remain strong with a slightly over 21  annual gain to over  30 billion  Results from Facebook  NASDAQ FB  lead many analysts to believe Google should see strong mobile ads  Strong results from Google could help keep the Nasdaq delivering fresh record highs 

Oil
Crude prices had their first major weekly decline in months as it appears momentum from the OPEC   production cuts and ending of sanction waivers on Iranian crude have run out of steam  Oil was ripe for a pullback and West Texas Intermediate crude may find strong support from the  60 a barrel level 
Over the week  Russian President Putin told reporters in Beijing   We have agreements within the OPEC   We fulfill our agreements and we don t have any news  any information  from our Saudi partners and any other OPEC member  that they are ready to exit these agreements    Markets are focused on whether or not China remains critical of the US decision on ending of waivers on purchasing Iranian crude  Putin took the opportunity to say Russia would be willing to meet China s oil demand needs  Which would imply the Russians are eager to ramp up production 
Russia appears to have every reason to resume ramping up production levels and the base case should start to become we will not see OPEC   agree upon extending production cuts with tweaks to cover the shortfall from Iran  If we do see an agreement  it would be surprising if we did see the Russians deliver 100  compliance  The Russian President did not deliver any updates on the contaminated oil in the Druzhba pipeline to Europe 
Oil remains very vulnerable here  but we could see some range trading here until Wednesday s Fed meeting  If we do see the Fed become more concern with low inflation and hint that we could see an insurance rate cut  that could provide a major dollar reversal  which should help propel risk assets and stabilize any weakness we see with crude early in the week 
Crude prices are slowly losing some of the key catalysts from this major rally and if we see the velocity in rising US production heat up  sellers may become in control in the short term 
The alleviation of global growth concerns will likely see a pickup in demand for oil  while the supply side argument will likely become bearish in the coming months  If we see a major dollar reversal  that should help oil prices become supported on any major selloffs 

Gold
The precious metal did not break last week despite major dollar strength in the first half of the week  The big event for this week could be the Fed s rate decision on Wednesday  If they signal that we could see a rate cut later in the year  that could be the key catalyst for gold to regain bullish momentum 
The Fed is likely to wait until after the summer if they were to signal a rate cut  but if they are overly concerned with tame inflation  they could tee up a cut sooner for the end of the year

309800,NFLX,All Mixed Up To Start A Big Week For The Market ,opinion,"We haven t seen many mixed markets since things started turning dicey for stocks in early October  But on Monday  that s exactly what we got  Another rough session for the FANGs meant that the NASDAQ couldn t join its counterparts on the positive side 
	The Dow climbed 0 76   or about 190 points  to 25 461 7  while the S P was up 0 56  to 2738 3  All three of the major indices are coming off a solid week of 2   gains 
	Except for Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX    2 05    the FANGs remained under pressure  The market hasn t gotten over Apple s quarterly report just yet  in which the iPhone maker beat on the top and bottom lines but was unimpressive when it came to shipments and guidance  It was off an additional 2 84  on Monday after falling 6 6  on Friday for its worst single day in years  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  was down nearly 2 3  as well 
	The FANGs really got messed up during the October selloffs and lost their seemingly insurmountable spot as market leader  And now President Trump is talking about antitrust proceedings against tech giants  though such statements were made in an interview with no actual movement on this issue in Washington 
	It was a low volume day in what is sure to be a very eventful week  First up  of course  is the midterm elections tomorrow  Most people believe the market will be just fine no matter what the Congress looks like after the votes are counted  The important thing is that a market uncertainty is cleared up 
	Then later in the week  the Fed s two day policy meeting comes to a close  Nobody expects a rate hike right now that will almost definitely come in December  But Jerome Powell and his Friends are being watched very closely by the market as its biggest concern right now is rising rates  We may get a sign on what the Committee plans to do next year amid a strong economy and a historic jobs market Today s Portfolio Highlights Momentum Trader  Since bottoming out on October 26  shares of Horizon Technology Finance  HRZN  have been up nearly every day  This business development company is now knocking on the door of its 52 week high  Dave likes the momentum he s seeing in this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  since it reported a solid earnings beat in its most recent quarter  The editor added HRZN on Monday with a 12 5  allocation  Read the full write up for more Surprise Trader  Car rental staple Hertz Global Holdings  HTZ  beat by more than 34  in its last quarterly report  Now we re getting ready for its next report on Thursday after the bell  and this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  has a solid Earnings ESP of 13 4   Dave thinks it is all set for another beat later this week  and so he bought a 12 5  allocation in HTZ on Monday  Read the complete commentary for more

435243,WMB, It s crazy   American Gauff wins first WTA title at age 15,news," Reuters    American teenage sensation Coco Gauff became the youngest player to win a WTA title in 15 years as she beat former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in the Linz Open final on Sunday 
The 15 year old Gauff  who started the season ranked well outside the world s top 600  beat Latvia s Ostapenko 6 3 1 6 6 2 in a topsy turvy contest 
She becomes the youngest WTA singles title holder since Nicole Vaidisova of the Czech Republic claimed her maiden crown in Tashkent at the age of 15 in 2004 
Gauff raced to a 5 0 lead in the final set before Ostapenko rediscovered her rhythm to save two match points and hold on for 5 1 
Ostapenko went on to break Gauff at love to make it 5 2 but the American held her nerve to seal victory on her third match point 
It concludes a remarkable week for Gauff  who went from failing to win her qualifier to entering the main draw as a lucky loser 
Gauff made her opportunity count by beating Stefanie Vogele  Kateryna Kozlova  top seed Kiki Bertens and Andrea Petkovic to reach the final 
 I m still overwhelmed and shocked   Gauff told reporters   I guess it s crazy to say it s my first WTA title 
 This was definitely not on the calendar at the beginning of the year  because I didn t think I d have a chance to get in  and now I m the champion  so it s crazy 
 My dad told me when I got in  before the first main draw match  You can t lose twice in the same tournament   I m sure he never thought it would come this far  to being the champion  but I guess he was right

385790,NWSA,Why Modern Monetary Theory Is Wrong About Government Debt ,opinion,I ve taken some criticism   particularly from advocates of  and and all that   for using total debt rather than just private debt in my work  The modern monetary theory line  in one sentence  and also   is that government debt levels are nothing to worry about  because governments are the issuer of the currency  and can always print more  This evokes the words of Alan Greenspan  The United States can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that  So there is zero probability of default  Of course  the point I am trying to make in worrying about total debt levels is not the danger of mass default  although certainly default cascades a la Lehman are a concern in any interconnective financial system   but that large debt loads can lead to painful spells of deleveraging and economic depression as has occurred in Japan for most of the last twenty years  where  has preceded Japan electing a leader who seems hell bent on trying to start a war with China  but that is another story for another day   Of course  before the crisis in America  as was the case in Japan at the beginning of their crisis  government debt was not really a great contributor to the total debt level  meaning that the  looks far more similar to the private debt line than the public debt line  which means that when I talk about the dangers of growing total debt I am talking much more about private debt than public debt   But what Japan empirically illustrates is the fact that all debt matters  Japan s private debt levels have reset to below the pre crisis norm  yet the economy remains depressed while public debt continues to climb  both in absolute terms  and as a percentage of GDP   If excessive private debt was the sole factor in Japan s depression  Japan would have recovered long ago  What we have seen in Japan has been the transfer of the debt load from the private sector to the public  with only a relative small level of net deleveraging  And high and growing public sector deficits lead to contractionary tax hikes and spending cuts  This happened time and again during Japan s lost decades  Peter Tasker of the  writes  When Japan s bubble economy imploded in the early 1990s  public finances were in surplus and government debt was a mere 20 per cent of gross domestic product  Twenty years on  the government is running a yawning deficit and gross public debt has swollen to a sumo sized 200 per cent of GDP  How did it get from there to here  Not by lavish public spending  as is sometimes assumed  Japan s experiment with Keynesian style public works programmes ended in 1997  True  they had failed to trigger durable economic recovery  But the alternative hypothesis   that fiscal and monetary virtue would be enough   proved woefully mistaken  Economic growth had been positive in the first half of the  lost decade   but after the government raised consumption tax in 1998 any momentum vanished  Today Japan s nominal GDP is lower than in 1992  The real cause of fiscal deterioration was the damage done to tax revenues by this protracted slump  Central government outlays as a percentage of GDP are no higher now than in the early 1980s  but the tax take has fallen by 5 per cent of GDP since 1989  the year that consumption taxes were introduced  A rise in debt relative to income has historically tended to lead to contractionary deleveraging irrespective of whether the debt is public or private  The notion at the heart of modern monetary theory that governments that control their own currency do not have to engage in contractionary deleveraging remains largely ignored  Just because nations can  in a worst case scenario  always print money to pay their debt  doesn t mean that they will always print money to pay their debt  They will often choose to adopt an austerity program  as is often mandated by the IMF   or default outright instead  as happened in Russia in the 1990s   And what governments cannot guarantee is that the money they print will have value  This is determined by market participants  In the real economy  and creditors    in particular are very afraid of inflation and increases in the money supply   is littered with currency collapses  where citizens have lost confidence in the currency  although in truth most hyperinflations have occurred after some great shock to the real economy like a war or famine  and not solely as a result of excessive money printing   And there has always been a significant danger of deleterious currency  trade and political retaliations by creditors and creditor nations  as a result of the perception of  money printing   Many  many wars have been fought over national debts  and over currencies and their devaluation  One only has to look at  regarding America s various monetary expansions  the fact that many  are moving away from the dollar as a reserve currency  as well as the   to see how loose monetary policy  of a far lesser order than the sort of thing advocated in modern monetary theory  can exacerbate frictions in the global currency system  Governments controlling their own currencies are likely to continue to defy the prescriptions of the modern monetary theorists for years to come  And that means that expansionary increases in government debt relative to the underlying economy will continue to be a prelude to contractionary deleveraging  just as is the case with the private sector  All debt matters ,2013-01-03,John

410763,COP,4 Stocks To Watch For Explosive Earnings Acceleration,opinion,Right from the top brass to research analysts  earnings growth captivates all  This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings Studies  however  have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement  Hence  earnings acceleration works even better in lifting the stock price Future OutperformersBasically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down Hence  earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance The Winning StrategyLet s look at stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1   The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2   The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3   The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3  In addition to this  we have added the following parameters Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This screens out the low

296207,TSLA,SolarCity  Timing Is Everything For This IPO,opinion,When the stock market is going up  there are always initial public offerings  IPOs   Timing  as they say  is everything  But with a meaningful trend  like the stock market breakout experienced this year   you can make good money speculating in IPOs  even if you can t get an allocation on the hottest deals  One small  but fast growing company that s been a hot performer is SolarCity Corporation  SCTY  out of San Mateo  California  It s been one of the best performing IPOs since listing  The company s timing could not have been more perfect  This business is more than just a solar panel company  It is a full service installer and repair service company that guarantees electricity production to customers  With net proceeds of approximately  95 0 million from the sale of approximately 13 2 million shares at  8 00 per share  this growing company is in full expansion mode  It has also had fantastic stock market success so far  and it s worth keeping an eye on  especially since Elon Musk from Tesla Motors  Inc   TSLA  is the company s chairman   Before listing  the company raised over  100 million in private equity to fund its growth  The company has a burgeoning customer base among large corporations and the U S  Armed Forces  By May   8 00 a share quickly became  50 00 a share  which isn t bad for six months  work  Extreme overvaluation is part of the game with IPOs  especially the ones that become immediately successful right after listing   See  How Peter Lynch Got It Right 20 Years Ago    Extreme price momentum with IPOs is very much a stock market reality when the key stock indices are ticking higher  The market bids the shares to astronomical levels in anticipation of the company delivering on growth  In a rising market  it definitely pays to research new IPOs  SolarCity s stock chart is featured below In terms of its business model  SolarCity generates a considerable portion of its revenues through the leasing of its solar energy systems with power purchase agreements  What s great about leasing is that it requires long term contracts  typically 20 years according to the company s form 10 Q  and provides a recurring revenue stream Before listing on the stock market  the company used to just sell its solar energy systems on an outright purchase basis  The company began offering leasing and power purchase agreements in mid 2008  this boosted the company s business considerably The majority of residential energy customers enter into leasing arrangements  while commercial and government customers enter into power purchase agreements  The company s total customer base grew 14  to 57 416 as of March 31  2013  up from 50 532 on December 31  2012 In the three months ended March 31  2013  SolarCity s total revenues were about  30 0 million  of which  15 1 million was due to operating leases  This compares to total revenues of  24 8 million  of which  8 14 million was operating leases  on December 31  2012 Without question  SolarCity s stock market valuation is off the charts and the company isn t even profitable  IPOs like this are as much about the concept as they are the business SolarCity is just the kind of company that can help revitalize the U S  economy  The company is hiring  it s expanding across the U S  market  and Wall Street loves the idea of it Stock market IPOs are typically overpriced  but that doesn t mean they can t make money  And SolarCity just might be the perfect example of this Disclaimer  Dear Reader  There is no magic formula to getting rich  Success in investment vehicles with the best prospects for price appreciation can only be achieved through proper and rigorous research and analysis  The opinions in this e newsletter are just that  opinions of the authors  Information contained herein  while believed to be correct  is not guaranteed as accurate  Warning  Investing often involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money  Please do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose ,2013-06-20,Mitchell Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/solarcity:-timing-is-everything-for-this-ipo-172165,172165
338143,RL,Textile   Apparel Industry Outlook  Spinning A Bright Yarn ,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies and lifestyle brands which produce  design  distribute and market basic and fashion apparel  footwear and accessories  The industry also includes providers of athleticwear and related equipment and fitness accessories  Most of the textile apparel players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and overseas Notably  some of the prominent industry players are V F  Corporation  VFC   lululemon athletica  LULU   Guess   Inc   GES   Hanesbrands  HBI   Ralph Lauren  RL  and Columbia Sportswear  COLM  Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Efforts to enhance brands via marketing strategies  licensing deals  buyouts  innovation and alliances are likely to keep backing players in the space  Also  focus on keeping pace with changing consumer preferences is a major driver  In this regard  rising inclination toward health and fitness is working in favor of activewear and sporting equipment providers  Also  many companies offer fitness gadgets and adopt other tracking platforms to make the most of consumers  evolving tastes  Textile apparel companies should keep benefitting from digital endeavors like upgraded payment systems  online purchases and pick up facility at stores  improved e commerce sites  and effective mobile apps  Although costs related to digital investments along with competition may hurt margins  stringent cost containment measures are expected to offer some support  Markedly  players are streamlining operations  optimizing portfolios and closing down underperforming stores to curtail costs  Wide international presence is a major positive for many players in the textile apparel space  Expanded global reach provides them with a sturdy business foundation and enables them to seek opportunities  especially in underpenetrated markets like Asia and Europe  However  this comes with risks associated with volatile currency movements and tariff impact Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Textile   Apparel industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  69  which places it in the top 27  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks  indicates solid near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are

302188,MSFT,Regression to Trend  A Perspective On Long Term Market Performance,opinion,Quick take  The S P 500 index price is 50  above its long term trend  up from 47  above trend last month    About the only certainty in the stock market is that  over the long haul  over performance turns into under performance and vice versa  Is there a pattern to this movement  Let s apply some simple regression analysis  see footnote below  to the question  Below is a chart of the S P Composite stretching back to 1871 based on the real  inflation adjusted  monthly average of daily closes  I ve using a semi log scale to equalize vertical distances for the same percentage change regardless of the index price range  The regression trendline drawn through the data clarifies the secular pattern of variance from the trend   those multi year periods when the market trades above and below trend  That regression slope  incidentally  represents an annualized growth rate of 1 73  The peak in 2000 marked an unprecedented 155  overshooting of the trend   nearly double the overshoot in 1929  The index had been above trend for two decades  with one exception  it dipped about 10  below trend briefly in March of 2009  But at the beginning of October 2012  it is 50  above trend  up from 47  at the end of the previous month  In sharp contrast  the major troughs of the past saw declines in excess of 50  below the trend  If the current S P 500 were sitting squarely on the regression  it would be around the 962 level  If the index should decline over the next few years to a level comparable to previous major bottoms  it would fall to the mid 400s  Footnote on Calculating Regression  The regressions on the Excel charts above are exponential regressions to match the logarithmic vertical axis  I used the Excel  to draw the lines  The percentages above and below the regression are the calculated as the real average of daily closes for the month in question divided by the Growth function value for that month minus 1  For example  the monthly average of daily closes last month was 1443 42  The Growth function value for the month was 961 99  Thus  the former divided by the latter minus 1 equals 50 05   which I rounded to 50   Footnote on the S P Composite  For readers unfamiliar with this index  see  for some background information ,2012-10-02,Doug Short,https://www.investing.com/analysis/regression-to-trend:-a-perspective-on-long-term-market-performance-138301,138301

What s Next for Lam Research

300435,MSFT,How To Profit From The Next Quantum Leap In Tech,opinion,"You ve seen the commercials  5G is on it way  and it promises to make your mobile browsing experience faster and more reliable than ever 
But if you re anything like me  your initial reaction to reports of 5G s upcoming rollout went something like this   What 5G   I was just getting used to 4G  
What is 5G  and why do telecoms  tech companies  and regulatory agencies seem to think we need it 
The phrase  5G  literally translates to  5th generation mobile networks   Easy enough  right  Well sure  but that opens up a whole new can of worms 
Why We Need 5G Now
If you haven t closely followed the historical progress of wireless communication   it s okay  I won t hold that against you   you may have missed some past generations 
The world retroactively labeled analog wireless networks  1G  when they were replaced by the earliest  2G  digital networks in the early 1990s  The third generation    3G    followed toward the turn of the century and introduced mobile internet access  video calls  and mobile TV   4G  was rolled out about a decade later to help usher in the golden age of smartphones 
As you can see  new wireless network generations tend to come about every ten or so years  and they typically coincide with a shift in use  2G enabled SMS text messages and eventually multimedia messages at a time when cellphones were getting smaller and more affordable  3G delivered new access to the internet  inspiring devices such as BlackBerrys and PDAs  Those products evolved into modern smartphones  and just a year after the iconic iPhone was released  we start to see the deployment of 4G 
Some of this shifting is easy to see as it s happening  and other times it s more recognizable after the fact  The latter may prove true once we see the influence that 5G has on the world when its fully unveiled  but the former is clearly occurring right now 
It s clear that mobile internet users have different wants and needs than they did a decade ago  One great example is the advent of video streaming  Millions of people looking to watch their favorite shows on the go face clogged networks and have to wait while their favorite shows buffer 
More so than that  5G needs to be able to support the next wave of human to object interaction  These past standards have primarily been based on human to human connection  5G is going to power the growing Internet of Things  IoT  and other technologies that seek to bring people closer to the world around them 
It s Going to Be Big
If there s one thing that those with an investing perspective should know about 5G  it s the sheer size of the potential market 
According to recent IHS research about  12 3 trillion worth of goods and services will be enabled by 5G networks by 2035  Nearly 22 million jobs will be created by new demands in the labor force related to 5G 
There are also huge amounts of money pouring into the business right now  For instance  semiconductor manufacturers   just one of several groups betting big on 5G technology   are spending a combined  200 billion a year on investments in 5G technologies  according to the IHS 
Continue reading      
                                                                                                      

Be among the early investors in 5G technology that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity 
Current networks will soon be outdated and replaced by new 5G devices  The process is expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3 trillion in activity 
A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this emerging tech  Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  in the 1990s  Zacks  just released special report reveals 7 stocks to watch  The report is only available until midnight Sunday  February 24 

                                                                                                      
The number of connected devices worldwide that could potentially link to 5G networks is growing rapidly as well  In a 2017 report titled  What the Future Might Hold for the Internet of Things   Global X Funds predicted that IoT connected devices would swell from around 19 billion in 2016 to nearly 80 billion by 2025  In all likelihood  each of these will be powered by 5G 
This is the type of growth market that investors can t afford to miss out on 
It s Also Going to Be Really  Really Small
The other part of this equation is the technical side  Wireless networks are a complex science  no doubt   but prudent investors will want to have a basic grasp of the tech before diving in 
5G is going to be lightning fast  The official requirements for the standard have not been finalized just yet  but the International Telecommunication Union  ITU    a group within the United Nations that approves standards proposals   has said that it must facilitate speeds up to 20 gigabits per second  or roughly 20x faster than the maximum speed of the best 4G networks in the world 
To do this  5G will utilize previously untapped radio frequencies called millimeter waves  mmWave   Once considered too low range to work for communication purposes  these ultra tiny frequencies pack a serious punch in the speed and bandwidth departments 
mmWaves are primarily located in the 30 to 60 gigahertz spectrum  Telecom giants and other tech firms are battling for control of this spectrum  scooping up licenses   and acquiring companies that already own licenses   left and right  Look for these tiny radio frequencies to grab huge headlines in the future 
How to Invest Now
By all accounts  5G will begin transforming the global economy in 2019  As mentioned earlier  the impact will be felt far beyond cell phones   although there will soon be hundreds of millions of 5G ready handsets on the market 
Mobile networks will finally be powerful enough to fully support other technologies like the Internet of Things  self driving cars and artificial intelligence  All told  the rollout of 5G will add approximately  3 trillion to the worldwide GDP 
But we re still early enough in the development of 5G technology that investors can still get in on the first wave 
That s why our team of experts here at Zacks has just released  This special report explores 5G in greater detail and lists 7 companies with first movers advantage in this space  Their stocks are also likely to be among the biggest beneficiaries of 5G s explosive growth 
Now is an ideal time to get started  As with any other emerging trend  the earlier you participate  the greater your potential profits can be  I encourage you to download the report right away  Please note  our 5G report is only available until midnight Sunday  February 24

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Top Stocks with Powerful Net Profit Margin 

Net profit margin is the most effective way to measure a company s profitability  A proper analysis of the same reveals how well a company is run and the headwinds confronting it 

A higher net margin reflects the company s efficiency at converting sales into actual profit Net Profit Margin   Net profit  Sales   100 
	In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures 
	Also  higher net profit is indispensable for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts new investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business 
	Moreover  a higher net profit margin as compared to peers lends a company competitive edge Pros and Cons
	Net profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors 
	However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that vital for technology companies 
	Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a complex task 
	Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt  instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective to analyze a company s performance 

The Winning Strategy
	A healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are two most sought after elements in a business model 
	Apart from these  we have added a few other criteria to ensure maximum returns from this strategy Screening ParametersNet Margin 12 months   Most Recent     greater than equal to 0   High net profit margin indicates solid profitability Percentage Change in EPS F 0   F 1  greater than equal to 0   It indicates earnings growth Average Broker Rating  1 5  equal to 1   A rating of  1 indicates brokers  extreme bullishness on the prospects of the stock Zacks Rank equal to 1   Only Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks are allowed  In good markets or bad  Strong Buy stocks continue to outperform  You can see

405057,WMT,The Income Inequality Trade  New Way To Profit From The Wealth Gap,opinion,We re living in a world of haves and have nots  It s the 99  versus the 1   as the Occupy Wall Street Movement likes to put it While I have a hard time believing that anyone truly thinks the rich are the enemy of the poor  there s no denying the discrepancy Based on the latest IRS data  the income gap between America s top earners and bottom earners hasn t been wider since 1928 But I m not here today to make a political statement   Other than saying that America is the land of the free  And in such a society  a degree of income inequality is inevitable  Instead  I m here to share an investment strategy to capitalize on the obvious trend Just the Facts  Ma amAgain  I m not going to refute that an income or overall wealth gap exists  Not when there s so much data to confirm it The top 1  of Americans now own about 40  of the country s  54 trillion in wealth  They also earn about 19  of the country s income  up from a low of 7 7  in 1973 Moreover  a new study by economists at UC Berkeley  the Paris School of Economics and Oxford University found that real incomes of the 1  grew 86 1  from 1993 to 2012  In contrast  real incomes of the 99  only increased 6 6  over the same period It s important to note that the discrepancy is materializing irrespective of geography or political persuasion  Or as The Washington Post s Brad Plumer notes   The Deep South  as well as New York and California  saw the fastest growth in income inequality over time  So this isn t a red or blue state thing  or an East or West Coast phenomenon  In fact  if you want to see how indiscriminate the spread of income inequality in America has been  check out this fascinating visual put together by John Voorheis  a graduate student at the University of Oregon   As income inequality within a state increases  the color in the image changes from red to green  Sentiment MattersNaturally  the difference in fortunes in America is leading to differences in sentiments between the  rich  and the  poor   too  And nowhere is this more evident than the latest Consumer Confidence readings In addition to the main reading that s widely quoted in the financial press  the Conference Board also measures confidence based on income  Sure enough  the confidence gap between Americans making more than  50 000 versus Americans making  35 000 to  50 000 has never been wider  according to Bespoke Investment Group  Put simply  wealthier people   as defined by the Conference Board s income levels   feel more confident than poorer people right now  That difference is naturally going to manifest itself in spending patterns  And therein lies the opportunity for us  The Perfect Time for a Pairs Trade Pardon the sweeping generalization  But it s nevertheless true  The have nots patronize Wal Mart  WMT   the world s largest discount retailer  Meanwhile  the haves patronize LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA  LVMUY   the world s largest luxury goods company   Its stable of high end brands includes Mo t   Chandon  Dom P rignon  Louis Vuitton  Fendi  Donna Karan  Marc Jacobs  TAG Heuer and Bulgari   Reflecting the broader income trends  the sales results for the former have been much weaker than the latter  And that makes this an ideal situation for a pairs trade  What exactly is a pairs trade  Pioneered in the 1980s by Morgan Stanley  MS   it involves taking a long position in one stock and a short position in another  At the same time  The way this two stock strategy sets us up to profit is simple  Scenario 1  The two stocks we own both go up  But the stock we re long goes up more and faster than the stock we re short  Scenario 2  The two stocks we own both go down  But the stock we re short drops faster and farther than the stock we re long  Scenario 3  The stock we re long goes up and the stock we re short goes down  The end result  Maximum profits  In this case  we d go long LVMH and sell short Wal Mart  As you can see in the chart below  doing so would have been profitable over the last year  Wal Mart s stock struggled to stay in positive territory  Whereas shares of LVMH are up almost 30   Bottom line  Given that the income and wealth gap isn t expected to narrow any time soon  I m convinced this pairs trade will continue to work in the months and quarters ahead ,2013-09-30,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-income-inequality-trade:-new-way-to-profit-from-the-wealth-gap-185818,185818

408119,GS,MSCI says domestic China shares still not ready for its global benchmark,news,"By Michelle Price
HONG KONG  Reuters    China has failed again to convince U S  index provider MSCI Inc to add local Chinese shares to its key emerging market index  and the company could not say when it was likely to give the green light  as global investors raised fresh objections 
The index company said on Tuesday that China still had to do more to make its markets accessible to foreign investors 
That is a blow for Chinese policymakers who have rushed to address MSCI s concerns over the past six months in the hope that inclusion in the Emerging Markets Index  tracked by  1 5 trillion in global assets  could draw up to  400 billion into China s stocks over the next decade 
Chinese shares seemed to shrug off the news  however  rising more than 1 percent in morning trade 
Market watchers and analysts said the surprise decision  the third year running it has said no  highlighted reservations among global institutional investors about yuan denominated assets and Beijing s commitment and ability to implement capital markets reform 
China s markets have had a turbulent 12 months  with a 40 percent crash in stocks  followed by heavy state intervention and an unprecedented exodus of capital that has put pressure on the Chinese currency 
 The decision highlights a much bigger issue  which is the resistance among global investors to allocate into yuan assets  despite the fact China is home to the world s second largest equity market and third largest bond market   said Peter Alexander  CEO of investment consultancy Z Ben Advisors in Shanghai 
He added that the decision put global investors  on the wrong side of history  
China s securities regulator said on Wednesday any global benchmark index that doesn t include China A shares is incomplete  but the decision wouldn t affect reforms to open its markets 
Remy Briand  MSCI global head of research  told reporters on Wednesday that China s reform programme was moving in the right direction but investors had concerns over the process for allocating investment quotas and monthly limits on repatriating capital 
He said investors also needed more time to assess if new share suspension rules would be effective in preventing a repeat of last summer  when more than half of China s listed companies halted trading in their stocks to sit out the crash 
 There have been a lot of significant improvements made recently by the Chinese authorities to improve accessibility for global investors  however  some of them are relatively recent  so we need a little bit of time to assess the effectiveness of these measures   Briand said 
NEW OBJECTIONS
MSCI this year raised new objections to a rule that requires foreign investors to seek approval from the country s stock exchanges before launching products based on A shares  which MSCI says could reduce investors  ability to hedge exposure 
 This is a very big problem for investors  and the removal of these requirements is necessary for inclusion   Briand said 
He added that the company could not commit to a timeline for inclusion and could not rule out the possibility that new issues may arise as discussions continued 
Under an industry consultation re launched in April  MSCI had proposed adding 5 percent of the free float value of 421 A shares  which would have accounted for 1 1 percent of its benchmark index  If the decision had gone China s way  the change would have taken effect in June 2017 
Expectations that MSCI would say yes this time climbed after Chinese authorities rushed through a series of fixes over the past five months  including relaxing the country s quota based foreign investment scheme  clarifying foreign ownership rights  and tightening up share suspension rules 
 Recent developments over the past weeks definitely skewed the decision closer to the favorable side in our view  so we are slightly surprised by this negative outcome   said Caroline Yu Maurer  head of Greater China equities at  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  Investment Partners in Hong Kong 
Many analysts had put the chances of inclusion at 50 percent or higher  with Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  raising the odds to 70 percent last month  In a note published on Wednesday  HSBC said it had  under estimated the resistance from the global investment community  
Tuesday s outcome highlighted growing divisions among global investors  with local China managers saying the decision process appeared to be driven by the concerns of MSCI s U S  client base  though the index is tracked globally 
Francois Perrin  portfolio manager  greater China markets  at East Capital  said MSCI put too much emphasis on the remaining problems with the QFII scheme and the product pre approval issue 
 It seems that many of these objections are coming from passive managers  based out of the United States  
MSCI said investors beyond Asia do tend to have more reservations  but it takes into account a range of investor feedback 
BlackRock  the world s largest passive manager  said   As a long term investor  we would welcome further progress in facilitating broader participation in the nation s domestic stock markets for international investors  ",2016-06-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/msci-says-domestic-china-shares-still-not-ready-for-its-global-benchmark-408407,408407

357109,LMT,United Technologies Is Undervalued Despite 12 5  Total Return Potential,opinion,"United Technologies  NYSE UTX  has paid increasing dividends for 45 years  The company has compounded investor wealth at 13 7  a year  including dividends  over the last 25 years 
United Technologies is one of the largest publicly traded diversified industrial goods manufacturers in the world  The company was founded in 1934 and has grown to reach a market cap of nearly  90 billion 
United Technologies Business Overview
The company operates in 5 segments  Each segment is listed below along with the percentage of total operating profits produced for United Technologies in  
Otis generated 26  of total operating profits
UTC Climate  Controls    Security generated 28  of total operating profits
Pratt   Whitney generated 20  of total operating profits
UTC Aerospace Systems generated 24  of total operating profits
Sikorsky generated 2  of total operating profits
Otis is the world s largest elevator and escalator manufacturing  installation  and service company 
UTC Climate  Controls    Security is the leading provider of HVAC and refrigeration solutions  The segment owns the Carrier and Kiddie brands  among others 
Pratt   Whitney is one of the world s largest suppliers of aircraft engines for both the commercial and military markets 
UTC Aerospace Systems provides advanced aerospace products and aftermarket service solutions for aircraft manufacturers  airlines  military  space  and undersea markets 
Sikorsky is one of the world s largest helicopter manufacturers  The segment s margins and operating profits were down significantly in 2014 versus 2013  United Technologies  it would sell its Sikorsky division to Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  for  9 billion  The company s management will use funds the money from the sale for share repurchases 
Recent Weakness   Wall Street Woes
Wall Street did not take kindly to United Technologies second quarter earnings and announcement of the Sikorsky divestiture  The company s stock declined 7 1  in one day  The decline was due to the Sikorsky divestiture and news that both the Otis and UTC Aerospace segments  profits are expected to be lower than management previously anticipated 
Is The Company s Debt Load Sustainable 
In addition to its recent weakness  United Technology also carries  22 4 billion in debt on its balance sheet versus  5 9 billion in cash  In 2014  the company had total profits of  6 6 billion  While United Technologies does have a large debt load  the company has an average interest rate on debt of around 4   This translates into under  900 million in interest payments a year   not overly concerning given the company s highly profitable operations 
If United Technologies were to see earnings fall drastically during recessions  the company s debt load would be worrisome  Fortunately  United Technologies tends to perform well during recessions  The company saw earnings per share fall just 15 9  during the worst of the Great Recession  
United Technologies  contracts with military and aerospace customers help to insulate it from recessions  The company s relatively stable earnings over a wide range of economic conditions make United Technologies  debt load sustainable 
Competitive Advantage  Growth    Total Returns
United Technologies is one of the largest diversified manufacturers in the world  The company s competitive advantage comes from a mix of its size and scale combined with lean manufacturing  technological know how  and existing contracts and relationships with large government customers 
The company invests in its employees as well  United Technologies  employee scholarship program has allowed employees to earn nearly 37 000 degrees since 1996  The company tries to provide a quality experience to all its stakeholders   employees  shareholders  and customers 
United Technologies  employees speak well of the company and the synergies generated between segments  This comment on Seeking Alpha from a former employee  quoted below  shows the reality of the synergies between divisions at United Technologies 
 As a former employee  and still a shareholder  of UTX who worked in both segments for over 15 years each I can attest in the great synergy between the two  referring to aerospace and building   Engineers  production  quality  and financial staff regularly collaborated on projects  
United Technologies  competitive advantages have driven 7 4  earnings per share growth a year over the last decade  Despite temporary weakness  management is targeting 10   earnings per share growth through a mix of organic growth  share repurchases  margin expansion  and acquisitions 
United Technologies will likely grow closer to its historical growth rate than management s expectations  I expect earnings per share growth of 7  to 10  a year over the next several years  This growth  combined with the company s  2 5  dividend yield gives investors expected total returns of 9 5  to 12 5  a year going forward 
Valuation   Final Thoughts
Recent pessimism surrounding United Technologies has driven down the share price  The company is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of just 14 4  United Technologies has traded for a price to earnings ratio above 16 for much of the past 2 years 
Wall Street may not have been fond of the Sikorsky divestiture  but the move should be very beneficial for shareholders  United Technologies  management will repurchase shares with the proceeds from the Sikorsky divestiture  The deal is  in the late 4th quarter of 2015 or early first quarter of 2016 
If United Technologies continues to trade for such a low price to earnings multiple through the Sikorsky divestiture  shareholders will benefit  Management will be able to repurchase a large block of shares   about 9  of the entire company   below fair value  Share repurchases done when a stock is trading below fair value are very accretive to shareholder value 
United Technologies currently has a dividend yield of 2 6   The company has a long history of rewarding shareholders with increasing dividends and rising earnings per share  United Technologies ranks highly using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing thanks to its solid scores for stability  growth  and yield  The company makes an excellent addition to the portfolio of long term dividend growth investors ",2015-08-04,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/united-technologies-is-undervalued-despite-12.5-total-return-potential-260493,260493

NYSE   NYSE KEM       Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  5 Best Performing Stocks of JulyMarkets finished with strong gains garnered over a month which featured stellar earnings releases  Tech stocks overcame overvaluation fears over most of this period  However  profit taking and portfolio reshuffling toward the latter half of July meant that investors had to give up on some of these windfall gains  Most economic data released during this period was encouraging even as the Fed refrained from raising rates  On the flip side  attempts to push through a new healthcare law failed  casting aspersions on the Trump administration s ability to implement its pro growth agenda July s PerformanceFor the month  the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq increased by 2 5   1 9  and 3 4   respectively  The Dow s great run was supported by excellent second quarter earnings released during the month  Leading companies which posted better than expected earnings include the likes of AT T  NYSE T   McDonalds  Boeing  NYSE BA   Verizon  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  However  the Nasdaq and the S P 500 lost out on some of the gains made earlier in the month  Tech stocks initially gained on strong tech earnings expectations which were expected to justify high valuations for the sector   Gradually  investors took profits off the table by selling off tech stocks and this weighed on the broader markets  curbing gains for these two benchmarks Also  the Trump administration s inability to repeal Obamacare hurt investor sentiment  Following this development  market watchers lost their faith in Trump s ability to bring about tax reforms and increasing spending on infrastructural growth among other items on his pro growth agenda  Moreover  the Fed s call to leave rates unchanged aided rate sensitive industries and helped in broad based gains Bullish Domestic DataThe majority of the economic data released in July indicated that the economy was on a firm footing  The ISM Manufacturing Index increased to 57 8 while the ISM Services Index increased to 57 4 in June  Industrial production moved up 0 4  in June  Notably  durable orders rose by 6 5  in June  which represents the largest increase since Jul 2014  Also  the Leading Indicators Index increased by 0 6  On the negative side  factory orders declined by 0 8  in May while retail sales slipped 0 2   CPI remained unchanged in June while core CPI gained 0 1   PPI and core PPI gained 0 1  each GDP Rises in Q2As per the advance estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Thursday  the real gross domestic product  GDP  increased at an annual rate of 2 6  in the first quarter of 2017  This was higher than analysts  estimates of an increase of 2 5   Further  it is nearly double the downwardly revised 1 2  pace of growth recorded in the first quarter A rebound in consumer spending helped boost overall economic growth  Consumer outlays grew 2 8  in the second quarter as Americans spent more on healthcare  groceries and clothes  Spending rebounded during the quarter  buoyed by an uptick in household finances  in turn powered by a buoyant labor market  Disposable income adjusted for inflation saw the best back to back quarters this year since the first half of 2015   Read   Housing Sector ImprovesOverall  data on the housing sector was bullish in nature  Housing starts increased by 8 3  from May  This represents a 2 1  annual increase  the highest recorded in four months  Building permits also increased  by 7 4   Pending home sales increased by 1 5  in June  ending three successive months of losses  New home sales increased by 0 8  in June  representing the second successive month of gains On the negative side  existing home sales lost 1 8  in June  following a record spike in home prices  More significantly  the NAHB Housing Market index lost 2 points to touch 64 in July  This is the lowest level recorded since Nov 2016  A spike in building material prices  particularly lumber was believed to be responsible for the decline Job Additions Rise  Unemployment Inches UpAccording to the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics the U S  economy added 222 000 jobs in June  much higher than the consensus estimate of 174 000  The addition of 222 000 jobs marked the second biggest job gains of the year Meanwhile  unemployment rate increased marginally from 4 3  to 4 4  in June  as more people came into the labor force searching for jobs  The  U 6   considered to be a broader measure of the unemployment as it includes those workers who are working part time for purely economic reasons  increased to 8 6  Payrolls data also showed that average hourly wages increased 0 2  to  26 25 against the consensus estimate of a rise of 0 3   Hourly pay has experienced an increase of 2 5  over the last twelve months  Additionally  the labor force participation rate for June increased marginally to come in at 62 8  Earnings Expectations Power Tech Rebound  Volatility PersistsTech shares began to rebound early in the month  with the Technology Select Sector SPDR  XLK  advancing by 1 2  on Jul 7  Investors regained their faith in tech shares after the sector suffered several setbacks following concerns over exorbitant valuations  Powering these gains were expectations of a stellar earnings show from big tech names  Market watchers believe that such a strong performance would justify the valuation levels of tech stocks Ultimately  Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Facebook s earnings surpassed estimates and delighted investors  In contrast  Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  posted a disappointing performance  As of Jul 28  we have Q2 results from 66 1  of the technology sector s total market cap in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these Technology companies are up  18 8  from the same period last year on  8 4  higher revenues  with 87 1  beating EPS estimates and 87 1  beating revenue estimates Consequently  the Technology Select Sector SPDR is up 4 5  and leads gains for the S P 500 s sectors  However  overvaluation concerns have returned to haunt tech stocks on occasion  raising volatility levels for the sector Q2 Earnings Likely to Set New RecordThe Q2 earnings season  which has crossed the half way mark already  reconfirms the positive earnings picture that emerged as a result of the preceding reporting cycle  With results from 286 S P 500 members out as of Jul 28  total earnings are up  11 3  from the same period last year on  6 1  higher revenues  with 74 5  beating EPS estimates and 69 2  beating revenue estimates Total Q2 earnings for the index are currently expected to be up  9 2  from the same period last year on  5 0  higher revenues  At the start of the quarter  the expectation was for earnings growth of  7 9   which came down as the quarter unfolded  reaching as low as  5 6  just ahead of the start of the reporting season Since plenty of results are still to come  the actual Q2 earnings growth could very well go above  10   which will follow the  13 3  earnings growth in the preceding quarter  The deceleration in Q2 earnings growth notwithstanding  the quarter s earnings tally is on track to reach a new all time quarterly record  surpassing the 2016 Q4 level  as you can see in the chart below   Read   FOMC MinutesMinutes of June 13 14 Federal Open Market Committee meeting were released during the first week of the month  Minutes showed that  several  officials supported paring back of Fed s  4 trillion plus bond portfolio within a  couple of months  Meanwhile  several Fed officials raised concerns over the impact of Fed s policy measures on financial markets  Officials indicated willingness to hike key interest rates further this year despite recent soft readings on inflation  Even though inflation is still short of central bank s target of 2   Fed officials believe inflation will reach its targeted level by 2018 Fed Leaves Rates UnchangedThe Fed opted to leave interest rates unchanged at the end of its two day policy meeting on Jul 26  The Fed maintained the benchmark lending rate and hinted that it will start trimming its  4 5 trillion balance sheet in  relatively soon   Market watchers believe that such language indicates that the Fed will begin the process of unwinding in September  Additionally  the central bank s statement dropped the word  somewhat  from its June statement instead choosing to directly state that inflation continued to remain  below 2   This only represents a slight shift but is significant because it acknowledges a negative view on one of the Fed s key objectives  The Fed s recognition of low inflation levels bodes well for rate sensitive sectors 5 Star Performers for JulyI ran a screen on for companies with the following parameters    Percentage price change over the last 4 weeks greater than or

tech stocks have mostly overcome overvaluation fears  Strong earnings performances from leading tech names have gone a long way toward dispelling such doubts  Meanwhile  the Fed s call to leave rates unchanged has also been welcomed by market watchers  Economic data has also mostly been bullish The only likely downside for stocks at this point is the Trump administration s failure to push through its pro growth agenda  However  given the predictability of such reverses  investors are likely to price in this factor sooner rather than later  In any case  these developments have had little material impact on the month s proceedings  This is why gains for stocks are likely to continue in August  powered primarily by stellar second quarter earnings numbers More Stock News  Tech

432316,C,U S  crude bounces from 14 week low  amid unexpected gas inventory draw,news,"Investing com    U S  Crude futures bounced from 14 week lows on Wednesday  as an unexpected draw in gasoline inventories last week helped temporarily ease some concerns related to the prolonged supply glut in global energy markets 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange  WTI crude for September delivery traded between  39 33 and  41 03 a barrel before closing at  40 80  up 1 29 or 3 26  on the session  It came one day after WTI closed below  40 for the first time since mid April when crude futures took a hit following the collapse of a closely watched Doha Agreement among major producers  including Saudi Arabia and Russia  On the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE   brent crude for October delivery wavered between  41 58 and  43 28 a barrel  before settling at  43 03  up 1 22 or 2 92  on the day 
Since hitting 2016 yearly highs of  51 a barrel in early June  U S  crude futures have slumped by nearly 20  over the last several weeks 
On Wednesday morning  U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report that Gasoline Inventories declined by 3 3 million barrels for the week ending on July 29  considerably more than analysts  expectations for a modest 0 2 million draw  Of the declines  stocks in the PADD 1 district covering the majority of the East Coast  fell by 1 2 million barrels for the week  The PADD 1 district  which has been beset by rising stockpiles in recent weeks  has still seen gasoline inventories soar by 11 5 million barrels over the last year 
The drawdown could help assuage some fears of long term oversupply among gasoline inventories worldwide  According to analysts from  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   gasoline inventories have soared to a near record high of 500 million barrels throughout the world  as refineries churn out product at a rapid pace amid low crude prices  Despite last week s draw  total petroleum inventories have spiked by approximately 25 million over the last nine weeks  according to Ion Energy Group analyst Kyle Cooper 
Overall  U S  commercial crude inventories increased by 1 4 million barrels for the period in comparison with the week ending on July 22  At 522 5 million barrels  U S  crude oil inventories are at historically high levels for this time of year  Analysts expected to see a decline of 1 4 million barrels  one day after the American Petroleum Institute reported a draw of 1 3 million barrels  At the Cushing Oil Hub in Oklahoma  inventories fell by 1 12 million barrels on the week  Cushing  the main delivery point for NYMEX oil  is the largest crude storage facility in the U S 
The U S  Dollar Index  which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies  rose by more than 0 40  to an intraday high 95 35  bouncing off five week lows  On Tuesday the index slipped below 95 for the first time since June 24  Before Wednesday s rebound  the Dollar had fallen sharply since hitting four month highs at 97 62 early last week

369481,COF,U S  CEOs unleash recession fears in earnings calls,news,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  companies are growing more concerned about the prospects of a recession in the year ahead for the first time since the end of the financial crisis  So far this year  the number of companies whose executives have mentioned recession concerns to analysts and investors is up 33 percent from the same period a year ago  the first such increase since 2009  Some 92 companies have discussed a U S  recession in their earnings calls  according to Thomson Reuters data   That gloomy talk highlights worries that growth in the world s largest economy may be coming to a halt  Gross domestic product grew 0 7 percent in the final quarter of 2015  down from 2 percent in the third quarter  while double the number of companies are cutting or flat lining their capital spending in the year ahead  according to Reuters data  The benchmark S P 500  a leading indicator of economic strength  had its worst January since 2009 as oil tumbled below  30 a barrel and remained near 12 year lows   While nearly all companies that have discussed recession say that U S  consumers continue to look healthy  many are growing concerned that the steep declines in energy prices and job cuts in the industry are going to bleed into the larger economy  Overall  economists expect the U S  economy to grow 2 4 percent in 2016  according to a Dec  30 Reuters poll   Richard Fairbank  chief executive of  Capital One  Financial  N COF  Co   for example  said he sees a recession as increasingly likely if financial market turmoil spreads into the real economy    Obviously  the economy is something of a wild card   he said    Perhaps the consumer economy is doing okay  but there is a depression in the energy economy and it feels like there is a general malaise if not a recession looming in the industrial and manufacturing economies   David Grzebinski  chief executive of tank barge operator Kirby Co told analysts   And household hardware maker Stanley Black   Decker Inc  N SWK  chief financial officer Don Allan told analysts that the company was prepared to cut jobs and pullback spending in the event of a slowdown   Not every company was downcast  however  Trucking operator Swift Transportation Co told analysts that one of its larger customers plans to spend  1 6 billion this year  up from  900 million last year

406358,GS,3 Reasons Why Buyback ETFs May Lose Momentum,opinion,"Though U S  companies repurchased  1 7 trillion of their own stock during 2012 2015  as per    the activity is going downhill this year  According to TrimTabs Investment Research  U S  stock buybacks dropped 21  in the first seven months of 2016 from the comparable year ago period 
Not only buyback  even dividend per share growth is likely to cool down from 9 3  in 2015 to 5 5  this year   Let s find out why the binge has lost luster and what s expected ahead 
Fed to Hike Rates
With a low interest environment commanding most developed economies including the U S   buyback gained precedence  But the Fed enacted a liftoff in December 2015 and may enact another one by this year end  Already  U S  Ttreasury yields are rising on the Fed hike prospect  So  accessing the debt market to finance buyback would not be an easy task in the coming days  read    
Dwindling Cash Piles with Corporates
Burdened by a year and a half of flagging profitsand expenses on activities like buybacks and dividends U S  companies have now started to see leakage in its huge cash loads  as per   Cash and equivalents dropped to a median  860 million for the S P 500 Index members in Q2  reflecting a three year low level 
In fact  half of the total cash is sitting with the top 50 wealthiest companies on the index  But the rest are seeing cash gushing out  at the fastest rate since the start of the bull market   Earnings recession for six quarters in a row was responsible for this cash exhaustion  Quite expectedly  the dearth of sufficient cash will limit stock buyback activity  lack
Overvalued Market 
A meaningful slowdown in share purchases can be the result of overvaluation in markets  At an inflated level of share price  companies are perhaps shying away from buying back their own shares 
Investors should note that the S P 500 hit all time highs several times this year to start Q3 despite the ongoing earnings recession  Several analysts are of the view that U S  equities are overvalued at the current level  With still tepid U S  economic recovery  corporate recession and the presidential election in November  markets are hovering at lofty levels 
Needless to say  companies will not repurchase their shares at higher prices than what they are actually worth  read    
How Have Buyback ETFs Performed This Year 
There are a couple of ETFs that focus on this niche strategy  PowerShares Buyback Achievers Portfolio  looks to track companies that have implemented a net reduction of 5  or more in shares outstanding in the last 12 months  PKW is up 2 3  this year but lost over 2 8  in the last one month  as of September 13  2016   The performance of PKW is weaker than SPDR S P 500 ETF   AX SPY   which hasyear to date returns of 4 6  and one month losses of about 2 7   see    
Another buyback ETF SPDR S P 500 Buyback ETF   AX SPY    which measures the performance of the top 100 stocks with the highest buyback ratios in the S P 500 in the last 12 months  has gained about 5 3  so far this year  However  the fund has lost over 1 7  in the last one month  as of September 13  2016  
AdvisorShares Wilshire Buyback ETF has added about 6  so far this year and was off 2  in the last one month  as of September 13  2016   Investors should note that the performance by SPYB and TTFS was relatively better than SPY  NYSE SPY   read   
Any Hope Ahead  
Investors should now be cautious while playing buyback ETFs given the looming concerns  If the broader market slumps ahead echoing what several analysts are foreseeing  the ongoing concerns about high equity valuation should fade out gradually  bringing back the buyback fervor 
Plus  corporate earnings are slowly returning to health with the S P 500 likely to see a 2 8  decline in earnings for Q3 and then moving on to the growth territory from Q4  as per the  issued on September 2  2016  As per the report  the S P 500 will likely see 5 2  earnings growth in Q4  11 3  in 1Q17 and 10 4  in 2Q17  If this happens  cash positions should recover gradually 
However  things might take time to settle down before the buyback zeal returns and the related ETFs are back in form

234574,CBRE,NMRK Vs  CBRE  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Real Estate   Operations stocks have likely encountered both Newmark Group  NMRK  and CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Newmark Group and CBRE Group are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
NMRK currently has a forward P E ratio of 5 66  while CBRE has a forward P E of 14 41  We also note that NMRK has a PEG ratio of 0 67  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  CBRE currently has a PEG ratio of 1 31 
Another notable valuation metric for NMRK is its P B ratio of 1 62  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  CBRE has a P B of 3 31 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to NMRK s Value grade of B and CBRE s Value grade of C 
Both NMRK and CBRE are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that NMRK is the superior value option right now ",2019-08-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nmrk-vs-cbre-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200453619,200453619

Research and development expenses for the reported quarter were  23 3 million  up 1 7  year over year due to increases in elacestrant project costs and abaloparatide patch project costs  General and administrative expenses decreased 14  to  41 2 million 
Pipeline Updates
The pipeline includes abaloparatide injection for potential use in the treatment of men with osteoporosis  abaloparatide patch for potential use in osteoporosis  and elacestrant  RAD1901  for potential use in hormone receptor positive breast cancer 
Radius Health presented a post hoc subset analysis on postmenopausal osteoporosis patients with type 2 diabetes from the phase III ACTIVExtend Study at the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists conference in April 2019  The ACTIVE Study cohort included patients with Type 2 diabetes  The data from the study showed that use of abaloparatide SC for 18 months led to significant improvement in lumbar spine TBS  trabecular bone score  and suggested that abaloparatide SC improved bone microarchitecture 
As the incidence of both type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis increase with age  they frequently coexist and represent a high unmet medical need population with a lower diagnosis rate for osteoporosis  compromised bone quality and higher fracture risk 
The company is developing two formulations   abaloparatide Subcutaneous  SC  and abaloparatide transdermal patch  Radius Health is on track with its preparations for the phase III trial on abaloparatide patch and expects to start the study in August 2019 
2019 Sales Guidance Updated
Radius Health expects Tymlos net revenues to be  160  175 million  previous guidance was  155  175 million in 2019  
Our Take
The narrower than expected loss in the first quarter was encouraging 
The company s sales surpassed expectation in the first quarter of 2019 as Tymlos continued to gain traction 
Tymlos market share increased in April  with a 34  share of the U S  anabolic osteoporosis market and more than 44  of new anabolic patient starts 
Shares of Radius Health have gained 28 2  in the year so far  outperforming the  s growth of 8 7  

 
During the second half of 2019  Radius Health expects the drug to become the NBRx anabolic market leader by reaching more than 50  of new patient starts 
Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential  Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly   Co s   NYSE LLY   Forteo and Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Prolia

309867,NFLX,Subscriber Numbers In Focus As Netflix Reports Q3 2018 Earnings Tuesday,opinion,"Reports Tuesday  October 16  after the close
Revenue Expectation   4B
EPS   0 68

There is little room for failure when Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  reports its Q3 2018 earnings later today after the US market closes  A repeat of Q2 s miss on net subscriber additions  when the streaming giant disappointed analyst expectations  will likely drive investors to punish the stock even more furiously than they did in mid July  when the stock fell 14  immediately after the report was released 

Since that disappointment  Netflix shares have been in hot water  Investors have been waiting on the sidelines to make sure that last quarter s weakness was just a blip in the company s remarkable growth story  rather than the start of a new trend 
In July  Netflix reported 5 15 million new subscribers for its second quarter a drop from the previous quarter s 7 41 million  and from the 6 2 million the company had forecast  The stock  which had hit an all time high of  423 21 in the period before the report  tumbled afterward  To date  with shares trading at  333 13 as of last night s close  the stock has plummeted by 21  
Analysts polled by FactSet expect Netflix to post earnings of  0 68 per share for the third quarter today  registering a 134  jump from a year ago  They are also expecting the company to add 5 32 million subscribers  about the same number as last year and slightly above Netflix s own forecast of 5 million  About 4 35 million of those are expected to come from international markets and 650 000 from the US 
If history is any indication  we may once again see Netflix report strong subscriber numbers today  crushing expectations  This is what happened in 2016  when streaming entertainment giant reported a similar miss in its seasonally weak second quarter  sending shares down by more than 14   only for the stock to double in value during the following months when subscriptions picked up 
Bottom Line
We believe that Netflix s key driver of growth  its original programming  remains intact both at home and abroad  The company has implemented an aggressive spending program to both create and market new content and the media services company is showing no signs of slowing down  Therefore  we believe that Netflix is in a strong position to surprise investors again today 
According to a survey by the Los Angeles Times in August  Netflix has released 88  more original programming so far this year than it did during the same period in 2017  The report lends credence to Netflix s own projection that it will spend  8 billion on original programming this year  about 27  more than it did last year 
With subscribers cutting their cable cords en masse  Netflix remains the only viable option to switch to  due both to its low cost  superior technology and the depth of its content  At this time  we don t consider the competitive threat from other streaming services to be a real challenge to Netflix 
With the stock at  333  all of the positive catalysts mentioned above create a strong buy the dip case for Netflix after its recent pullback 
However  despite our positive predictions for Netflix  it s important to point out that we see limited upside potential on any positive earnings surprises today  The macro market environment has deteriorated significantly since July 
High growth stocks such as Netflix  which rely heavily on debt to fund their growth  are likely to see a squeeze in their margins as interest rates continue to rise in the US  That headwind  combined with the market volatility  make Netflix stock vulnerable even if it meets  or potentially beats expectations ",2018-10-16,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/netflix-stock-a-key-number-to-watch-when-streaming-giant-reports-q3-today-200348560,200348560

262709,BAC,Biggest Risk Flight Since 2016 Pushes BofA Closer to Buy Signal,news," Bloomberg     A torrent of fund outflows has taken Bank of America Corp  NYSE BAC   s contrarian Bull   Bear Indicator to a two year low  pushing it closer to a buy signal for risk assets 
Emerging market equity  financials and investment grade funds have suffered their biggest exodus since late 2016 as trade tensions and tighter monetary policy spur investors to separate the wheat from the chaff 
 At the moment  you re seeing this unwind of the euphoria from January but nothing is so stretched that it s a full buy signal   Tommy Ricketts  a global investment strategist at the bank said by phone   You d have to see things really deteriorate  
Investors pulled  7 7 billion from emerging market equity and investment grade credit funds in the week to June 20 since late 2016  according to BofA  citing EPFR Global data  Withdrawals from developing nation and high yield debt continued for the ninth and seventh consecutive week  respectively  reaching  3 billion combined 
All told  about  13 billion fled equities and  6 billion bonds  driven by mutual fund outflows 
It s a volte face from early 2018 when the largest ever allocation into stocks took the U S  bank s sell signal to highest since March 2013 
The Bull   Bear Indicator uses fund flows  positioning data and market technicals to quantify investor sentiment  This week it dropped to 2 9  with anything lower than 2 constituting a buy signal 
What would it take to break through that level  Further outflows  a tumble to less than 2650 for the S P 500  compared with 2761 currently  or weak U S  jobs data that disrupts the monetary trajectory  according to Bank of America

328362,LAMR,Lamar Alexander opposes witnesses  likely sealing quick end to impeachment trial,news,"Sen  Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   said Thursday night he would not vote to hear witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump  likely dooming a bid by Democrats and moderate Republicans and heralding the quick end of the trial  A vote to call witnesses is expected Friday  and is now likely to be blocked by Republicans  who may move to acquit Trump as soon as Friday night   In a statement  Alexander said   There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution s high bar for an impeachable offense   The Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate    The question then is not whether the president did it  but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did  I believe that the Constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday   Our founding documents provide for duly elected presidents who serve with  the consent of the governed   not at the pleasure of the United States Congress  Let the people decide    Alexander was seen as the key swing vote for or against calling witnesses  Since Republicans hold a 53 47 majority in the Senate  Democrats need at least four Republicans to join them in seeking witness statements  Maine s Susan Collins  Alaska s Lisa Murkowski and Utah s Mitt Romney  all moderate Republicans  appear likely to vote to hear witnesses   The New York Times reported earlier this week that Bolton says in a forthcoming book that Trump personally told him that nearly  400 million in security aid to Ukraine should be withheld until Ukrainian officials agreed to investigate Democrats  including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son  Hunter  That would undercut a key line of defense for Trump  whose lawyers have said the aid holdup was unrelated to any investigation  Trump s defense asserted Wednesday that even if Trump did seek  quid pro quo  from Ukraine  it was not an impeachable offense

280614,AAPL,You Thought U S  Politics Were Crazy  Take A Look At Italy,opinion,"And you thought the U S  political scene was wild and crazy  In Italy  over the weekend  the sitting President used his constitutional powers to block the creation of a legally elected government which already controls the Parliament  This will force new elections which will likely give the populist parties even more power and guarantee an even larger shift away from the EU  We will quickly need an Italian name for Brexit on steroids  And if you own assets in Italy  your portfolio is going to need something much stronger than steroids to keep it afloat  Meanwhile  the euro moves one step closer to becoming a broken currency that will only further benefit European manufacturing exports and tourism  while sending inflation straight up  Who is going to tell Merkel and Macron to cancel their summer vacation plans 
There is unfortunately much more to worry about globally  The U S  steel tariffs expire this week and in another reversal  the Administration has now decided to implement tariffs on China  Speaking of which  has anyone seen the U S  Treasury Secretary since last week when I suggested he had the upper hand in the Chinese trade negotiations  Since hitting the news shows on Monday  he has disappeared  Like completely  I was wrong to suggest that the White House was turning over a new leaf on the trade negotiations  It is clear that no one outside the Administration  or maybe even inside  has any knowledge as to what is being considered or implemented  Like the Colorado weather  just wait 6 hours and it can change wildly 
In other countries  the Turkish lira is trying to halt its steep slide  Brazil is feeling social unrest pressures from a soaring U S  dollar  Argentina continues to see volatile investment flows and Spain is having its own Presidential political problems  All of these rising global tensions is creating a sudden flight to safety sending U S  Treasuries  German Bunds  the yen and the Swiss franc sharply higher 
For a world  which two weeks ago was betting on rising U S  rates and bonds breaking a 10 year trendline  this can be painful if you are not positioned correctly  One investor group on edge right now are the many U S  equity portfolio managers who are overweight financial stocks  This sudden move lower in interest rates  coupled with an ever flattening yield curve and now rising question marks on euro periphery assets  will place those positions at risk 
Also the soaring U S  dollar will put pressure on their lending books exposed to U S  exporters as Europe ramps up their factories  On the flip side  U S  Small Caps continue to remain in the driver seat as long as the U S  economy holds together  So  hope you enjoyed the long weekend because it will be a long grind in the markets until the next three day weekend in 14 weeks 
You pay attention to any market that has its biggest move on record 
Today s spike in two year Italian yields is outpacing anything seen during the euro zone crisis in 2011 and 2012  The yield on two year notes is up around 150 bps at 2 40   having touched 2 83   the highest level since 2012 
  business 

And not just a big move  but a doubling in interest rates 
Italy s bond market suffered a steep sell off on Tuesday  sending the yield on the country s two year bond to the highest level in more than four years as concerns about political turmoil in the eurozone s third biggest economy intensify  The yield on two year Italian debt broke through 2 7 per cent for the first time since 2013  reaching as high as 2 73 per cent   up nearly 2 percentage points from Monday s market close 
The yield on 10 year debt hit 3 388 per cent  up 70 bps from the previous close  Yields rise when prices fall  Investors have been selling Italy s bonds and equities after the country s president  Sergio Mattarella  frustrated a bid by the Five Star Movement and League to form a coalition government  Investors fear that his move will trigger new elections that might give a more explicitly Eurosceptic mandate to the two populist parties

Even the chance of default has soared in Italy

U S  dollar pain in Brazil 
The strong U S  dollar and falling Brazilian real has sent the cost of fuel surging leading to trucker strikes across the country which has shut down the economy 
Brazil s President Michel Temer late on Sunday announced measures to try to end a week long truckers  strike that has paralysed Latin America s largest economy and threatened to undermine his government 
The measures  which included a cut in the price of diesel  came as the economic cost of the strike mounted   petrol was unavailable across much of the country and poultry producers were forced to cull 64m birds for lack of chicken feed 
 Throughout this week  my government has always been open to dialogue   the president said in a terse announcement on national television  conceding a cut of R 0 46   0 12  per litre  or an average of about 12 per cent 
The strike started a week ago and has gathered momentum after fuel costs in Brazil soared  hit by a perfect storm of rising international oil prices and a sharp depreciation in the real  In spite of calling in the army on Friday to guarantee deliveries for essential services  such as petrol for airports and security forces  Mr Temer has been unable to end the strike  On Sunday  strikers were showing little sign of giving in  challenging the president s authority 
 Financial Times 
To confuse you even further  the White House unfroze the tariffs on China on Monday morning 
The Administration s lack of strategy or defined goals was especially evident in the President s seesaw on China this week 
On Monday he boasted that a weekend deal to withdraw tariffs was  one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years   The next day he complained that he was  not satisfied   then tweeted Wednesday that  Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely  but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion  
 WSJ 
So clearly the long investing bet on tariff confusion is trading vessels and shipping fuel 
A ship carrying sorghum is literally riding the waves of the fractious relationship between China and the U S  over trade 
The bulk carrier RB Eden was loaded with the grain at Archer Daniels Midland Co  s terminal in Corpus Christi  Texas  and was initially bound for Shanghai  When China announced a 179 percent tariff on imports of sorghum in mid April  it performed a U turn in the Indian Ocean  according to vessel data tracked by Bloomberg  and sailed back around southern Africa toward Europe 
The vessel s destination was changed to Cartagena  Spain  but according to the data  it never docked  On May 18  China scrapped its anti dumping and anti subsidy probe into sorghum 
The same day  the RB Eden began sailing back toward the Atlantic  It s currently bound for Singapore

Steel tariffs hit our trading partners this week  so expect sharp retaliation 
U S  high yield credit has held in well  Will it continue 
President Donald Trump s maximalist approach in recasting his nation s trade relations may soon hit U S  farmers and manufacturers  as America s trade partners prepare retaliatory tariffs that could generate  3 45 billion in revenue

The impact of rising labor and material costs on Toll Brothers hit hard last week 
For the three months to end of April  revenue came in at  1 6bn  a 17 per cent jump from the prior year period as the company sold more houses at higher prices 
However like other sectors across corporate America  Toll Brothers is also being squeezed by higher construction material costs and labour shortage 
Gross margin fell to 22 5 per cent during the quarter from the 24 3 per cent reported in the prior year period as prices for everything from lumber to transport and labour rose 
As a result net income fell 10 3 per cent to  111 8m  or 72 cents per diluted share  confounding Wall Street expectations of 76 cents a share 
 Labor is tight   chief executive Douglas Yearley said during a call with analysts  He said labor probably accounts for 20 30 per cent of the cost increase the company is seeing  with the rest attributed to higher lumber and construction material prices

 Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment 
Has the  Highlander  theme returned to M A for banks 
The US s banks have largely sat out the mergers and acquisitions wave of recent years  While deal records have fallen in almost every other sector  big banks have done almost nothing  shrinking rather than expanding  And merger activity among small and mid sized banks   some 5 607 of them  at last count   has been subdued 
But when Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB  of Cincinnati revealed its  4 7bn swoop for Chicago s MB Financial on Monday morning  shares in other Chicago area banks began to move  too  Wintrust  a similar sized bank based in Rosemont  Illinois  ended the day up almost 4 per cent  while First Midwest of Itasca closed up 3 per cent 
The implications were obvious  after years of thin activity in bank M A  this deal could mark a turn 
The conditions for dealmaking look better than at any time since the financial crisis  Higher interest rates and lower taxes have pumped up bank profits  giving management teams stronger platforms from which to contemplate doing something radical  Data released on Tuesday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation showed that net income across the banking industry rose 27 per cent from a year earlier in the first quarter  to a record  56bn 
Shareholder activists have also begun to flex their muscles  calling for fresh ways to boost returns at Ally Financial Inc  NYSE ALLY   Comerica  NYSE CMA   Citigroup  NYSE C   Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  and Regions Financial  NYSE RF   among others  And then   most importantly   there is the shifting regulatory landscape

So how long until a technology or financial company acquires Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  to get its hands on its mobile payments app 
By the end of this year  a quarter of U S  smartphone users   55 million people   over the age of 14 will make an in store mobile payment  More than 40 percent of those people will have done so through Starbucks s mobile payments app  according to new data from research firm eMarketer 
The Starbucks app  which launched before the other three top payments apps   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Pay  Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Pay and Samsung  KS 005930  Pay   has long been the most successful payments app  It s likely going to maintain that lead over the next few years 
The Starbucks app lets users pay with their phones and earn credits toward future purchases  That usage is significant  Starbucks said its mobile order and pay system accounted for 12 percent of all U S  transactions in the quarter ended April 1

In the first three months of 2018  Denver posted a  net outflow  of Redfin users for the first time  meaning that more Denver based Redfin users were searching for homes in other metro areas than Redfin users elsewhere looking to move in  Of all Denverites using Redfin  20 percent were searching for homes in another metro  up from 15 percent during the same time period a year earlier  Nationally  23 9 percent of Redfin com users looked to relocate to another metro area last quarter  up from 19 8 percent a year earlier

Classrooms must have air conditioning 
The first study putting numbers to those thoughts you had while melting across that summer afternoon classroom desk 
We provide the first evidence that cumulative heat exposure inhibits cognitive skill development and that school air conditioning can mitigate this effect  Student fixed effects models using 10 million PSAT takers show that hotter school days in the year prior to the test reduce learning  with extreme heat being particularly damaging and larger effects for low income and minority students  Weekend and summer heat has little impact and the effect is not explained by pollution or local economic shocks  suggesting heat directly reduces the productivity of learning inputs  New data providing the first measures of school level air conditioning penetration across the US suggest such infrastructure almost entirely offsets these effects  Without air conditioning  each 1 F increase in school year temperature reduces the amount learned that year by one percent  Our estimates imply that the benefits of school air conditioning likely outweigh the costs in most of the US  particularly given future predicted climate change

394263,GT,Are Corporate Investors Ignoring Long Term Stability For Easy Debt ,opinion,"A recent  in the New York Times illustrates a wider issue across the corporate world which has developed in the last 10 to 20 years  not just in the US but increasingly across most western markets 
The story starts fittingly in America s heartland with two businesses run as one under the banner of the family name Timken  NYSE TKR   Old man Henry Timken  a carriage maker  moved his bearing business to Canton  Ohio  from St  Louis in 1901  anticipating the growth of the auto industry  Steel was added with a specialty in the grades needed for the bearing business and later in the oil industry and other specialist applications 
The Timken family are still there 117 years later and their support keeps the city of Canton functioning better than the nearby city of Akron where Goodyear  NASDAQ GT  pulled out after nearly 100 years making tires  Timken is not just about jobs and salaries  crucial as those are 
Over the last 5 years  the Timken family  foundation and company have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the city s biggest hospital  and at least  3 5 million to ArtsinStark  a private arts council that supports Canton s art museum  ballet  symphony and other cultural institutions  In fact  the Timken Foundation built Timken High School in the late 1930s  the paper reports and the foundation poured  10 million into the school from 1997 to 2002 after graduation rates plunged  The district used the money to pay for new math and science programs as well as to renovate the campus 
The article strikes a balanced stance  it stresses the Timken family have  in turn  earned handsomely out of their ownership of the business over the years  They are certainly not bleeding heart liberals but staunch republicans  but republicans of an older hue maybe with an almost paternalistic sense of responsibility to the community in which they live and work 
The point the Times is trying to make in this article is not the rights or wrongs of Timken s philosophy  more that it  along with much else in corporate America  the firm is at risk from the short termism that has become the prevailing wisdom over the last 10 to 20 years  Shares in Timken were bought up in 2012 by an activist investor called Relational from San Diego 
Relational along with support from the California State Teachers  Retirement System  known as Calstrs  mounted a year long campaign to  unlock value  in Timken s underperforming share price  Timken carried very little debt  partly because the family felt that gave them a cushion during the notoriously cyclical down times in the steel industry  But activist investors like debt  whether to make acquisitions or to increase dividends and finance large scale stock buybacks 
The investor felt the 2 firms would be worth more apart and in fact  Relational s model for a broken up Timken suggested the 2 resulting pieces could afford to take on just over  1 billion in fresh debt the paper said  Debt that could be used for share buybacks and boost the share price   not in the investors  view   for investment 
Bill George  a Harvard Business School professor is quoted as saying   Activists think long term is 12 months and the first thing that goes is the stuff that pays off in 5 or 10 years   adding  America s strength isn t from low labor costs  It s from research and development and capital investment  
You cannot do that stuff on a short term focus and while financing a mountain of debt  As a result of the investor s pressure  Timken duly broke into 2 firms  One was Timkensteel  NYSE TMST  making high end steel  the other Timken bearings  Whilst it has one of the most modern slab casters in North America and operates profitably in it s niche  the steel division is now ripe for a takeover by one of the majors  with the cost cutting and rationalization that will inevitably be part of that process 
Meanwhile  Relational has unloaded its entire position in both Timken and TimkenSteel  Relational acquired its stake at about  40 a share and sold at  70  reaping a 75  gain    188 million   in just over 2 years  The firm hasn t done anything illegal  arguably it hasn t even done anything immoral  it has simply operated within the rules of engagement we have all come to expect and accept as normal in today s world 
Yet  as year end approaches so to does that time to step back from day to day work and reflect on the wider environment in which we work  and maybe ask ourselves  is this the kind of behavior we want to encourage  Could there not be a better way  The people of Canton no doubt think there could be as they look at a new year that holds less job security than at anytime for the last hundred years

432572,JPM,U S  jobs market tightens  inflation pressures cooling,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week  pointing to shrinking labor market slack that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again this year despite moderate inflation growth   Inflation could remain sluggish for a while as other data on Thursday showed import prices recorded their biggest drop in 15 months in May  The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates for the second time this year amid expectations of moderate economic growth and further strengthening in the labor market   Labor is scarce and separations are low as companies try and hang onto skilled labor   said John Ryding  chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York   At present  it appears the labor market data rather than the inflation data are in the driving seat for data dependent Fed policy   Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8 000 to a seasonally adjusted 237 000 for the week ended June 10  the Labor Department said on Thursday  better then economists  expectations for a decline to 242 000   Claims have now been below 300 000  a threshold associated with a healthy labor market  for 119 straight weeks  That is the longest such stretch since 1970  when the labor market was smaller  The labor market is near full employment  with the jobless rate at a 16 year low of 4 3 percent  While monthly job growth has slowed  record high job openings suggest that is likely because companies cannot find qualified workers  The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 6 000 to 1 94 million in the week ended June 3   The so called continuing claims have now been below 2 million for nine straight weeks  pointing to diminishing labor market slack  The upbeat labor market data helped to lift the dollar against a basket of currencies while prices for U S  Treasuries fell  Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower  led by technology shares amid worries over stretched valuations  MIXED FACTORY DATA In another report  the Labor Department said import prices declined 0 3 percent last month as the cost of imported petroleum products tumbled  That was the biggest drop since February 2016 and followed a 0 2 percent increase in April  In the 12 months through May  import prices rose 2 1 percent  the smallest gain since last December  Import prices rose 3 6 percent year on year in April  The slowdown in import prices suggests domestic inflation could remain soft for a while  Consumer inflation measures have slowed in recent months  retreating below the U S  central bank s 2 percent target   The Fed on Wednesday acknowledged the ebb in price pressures and said it expected annual inflation rates to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the target over the medium term   In May  import prices excluding petroleum were unchanged after increasing 0 3 percent in April  They increased 1 0 percent in the 12 months through May   Not enough to stir up inflation pressures   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York  A third report from the Fed showed manufacturing production fell 0 4 percent last month  weighed down by a 2 0 percent drop in motor vehicle assembly  With auto sales slowing and inventories bloated  motor vehicle production could remain a drag on factory output for a while  Manufacturing output jumped 1 1 percent in April  It rose 1 4 percent in the 12 months to May  pointing to underlying strength in manufacturing  which accounts for about 12 percent of the U S  economy  That was supported by a survey from the New York Fed showing its Empire State current business conditions index surged 21 points to 19 8 in June  the highest reading since September 2014  While another survey from the Philadelphia Fed showed a measure of business conditions in the mid Atlantic region fell to a reading of 27 6 this month from 38 8 in May  unfilled orders and delivery times increased

359639,TMO,Boston Scientific Grows On New Products  Currency Woe Ails,opinion,"On Oct 9  2017  we issued an updated research report on leading medical devices company  Boston Scientific Corporation   NYSE BSX   
Over the past three months  Boston Scientific has been trading above the broader industry  The stock has improved 7  compared with the broader  s 4 7  gain during the period 
Among the recent upsides  worth mentioning is the company s acquisition of Symetis  in a bid to fortify the European structural heart business  We are also encouraged by the company securing multiple product approvals both in domestic as well as overseas markets  Notably  the company received an FDA approval for the RESONATE family of ICD and CRT D systems 
Additionally  the market holds optimism on the stock  following the company s recent release of an outline on sustained growth strategy  focusing on planned expansion in new markets and consolidating product lines across all business segments  The company particularly plans to launch products into high growth adjacent markets with a strong potential to reap an incremental  13 billion in market opportunity by 2020 Boston Scientific Corporation Price and Consensus

   While adverse foreign exchange continues to pose challenges  we are concerned with the company s recall of one of its prime products  Lotus range of heart devices  It is important to note that last quarter  foreign exchange headwind affected the company s top line by  23 million and adjusted gross margin by 50 basis points 
Also  a dull defibrillator sale within its core Cardiac Rhythm Management  CRM  continues to remain a drag for overall growth  The woes of a challenging economy and a competitive landscape persistently burden the stock 
However  given the company s bullish second quarter 2017 results and several recent developments  we find quite a few positive factors to rely on  The company is leaving no stone unturned to reinforce its core businesses and invest more in global markets

402270,AMZN,Will The New Fire Phone Heat Up Amazon com s Sales This Quarter ,opinion," NASDAQ AMZN  is set to report FQ2 2014 earnings after the market closes on Thursday  July 24th  The e commerce company s revenue will be under the microscope again on Thursday  as Wall Street is predicting another quarter well into the red  CEO Jeff Bezos has been running the same strategy at Amazon for quite some time  just keep increasing sales and spend money like crazy on increasing the size and scope of the business  This quarter Amazon rolled its new and first ever smartphone  the Fire Phone  The screen s got a pretty cool 3D screen  but the real appeal of the the phone is that it should make it easy for shoppers to find goods they want to buy directly off Amazon com  Analysts will also be looking for sales of the new Fire TV set top box which was released back in April  Here s what investors are expecting from Amazon this quarter  

This quarter 44 contributing analysts on  have come to a consensus loss expectation of  3c per share and  19 410B in revenue compared to a consensus of  13c EPS and  19 329B from Wall Street  This quarter neither Wall Street or the Estimize community except a profitable quarter from Amazon  but both groups are looking for solid year over year growth of 23   which would be in line with the average sales growth rate over the past year  

The Estimize community is more optimistic than the Street this quarter  but still looking for the quarterly loss to increase compared to the same period of last year  This quarter costs associated with the rollout of 2 new products are likely to hold Amazon back on the bottom line  but the business will continue to grow and Jeff Bezos will have even more cash to throw back into the reinvestment funnel  

Estimize com ranks and allows the sorting of analysts by accuracy  the analyst with the lowest error rate on Amazon is a information technology professional who goes by the username splangile  Over 2 previously scored estimates on Amazon splangile has averaged an error rate of 5 5   Estimize is completely open and free for anyone to contribute  and the base of contributing analysts on the platform includes hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  non professional investors  and students 
The Estimize consensus was more accurate than the Wall Street consensus 65  of the time last quarter on the coverage of nearly 1000 stocks  A combination of algorithms ensures that the data is not only clean and free from people attempting to game the system  but also weighs past performance and many other factors to gauge future accuracy 

Contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are forecasting that on Thursday Amazon will report a loss 10c per share smaller than Wall Street s earnings forecast and beat the Street s revenue consensus by  81 million   1    Investors have been hard on Amazon in 2014  but since May they seem to have been cutting the e commerce site some slack  This quarter Amazon will need to prove that all the money it has spent on developing its new smartphone and TV set top box products will translate to a big payoff on the revenue side ",2014-07-24,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-the-new-fire-phone-heat-up-amazon.com’s-sales-this-quarter-220436,220436

in demand  the executives and employees of South Korea s cosmetics companies  who are being lured by Chinese rivals as a battle for China s huge beauty market heats up   Chinese make up brands including Jala  Proya  603605 SS  and Suhu   which have long trailed Korean rivals in terms of quality   are hiring South Korean executives as well as spending up on research and buying overseas firms  industry executives and headhunters say   The moves seem to be helping   Chinese brands  which compete with Korea names from top rated Amorepacific  KS 002790  to nimble budget makers such as Clio  KQ 237880   are gaining market share in the mid range and premium cosmetics sector where South Korea has traditionally had strength in China  While Chinese companies have been gaining ground for some time  the trend appears to have accelerated this year after Seoul s decision to install a U S  anti missile system against Beijing s wishes sparked a backlash against Korean companies   At stake is a bigger chunk of China s  50 2 billion beauty and personal care market  which research firm Euromonitor projects will grow to  61 9 billion by 2020  Jason Yu  Shanghai based General Manager of market research firm Kantar Worldpanel  said mid tier or  masstige  Korean brands were most exposed to Chinese brands improving their offering  High end brands from France s L Oreal  PA OREP  and Japan s Shiseido  T 4911  tended to attract wealthier buyers   In terms of the price position  they will be more in direct competition with the emerging Chinese brands who are moving up the price ladder   said Yu  adding Chinese firms were  catching up very fast   HIRING SPREE There are signs that recent diplomatic tensions have played into the hands of local Chinese brands in their battle with Korean rivals  Amorepacific s sales fell 8 percent in the January to September period from a year earlier  while operating profit skidded 30 percent  Smaller  budget makers were hit harder  with Clio s operating profit falling nearly 70 percent  While some Chinese make up brands use South Korean stars or highlight Korean links  others are playing up Chinese elements such as using traditional medicine ingredients or use slogans about suiting Chinese skin  Zoe Zhuang  24  an engineer in Nanjing  said she used to use cushion foundations and eye pencils from South Korea s Etude brand  She now uses more Chinese to  support local brands   she said  without referring to the dispute over the THAAD missile system    I actually don t think Chinese makeup is that good yet  there is plenty of room for improvement   she said  Chinese cosmetics firms have been trying to close the quality gap by aggressively targeting South Korean executives     Chinese cosmetics brands  are recruiting Koreans in almost all areas  including brand managers  packaging design  store interiors  purchasing and marketing   Choi Sun hee  head of South Korean recruiting firm HR Biz Korea  told Reuters  Some Chinese brands are willing to offer 50 percent higher wages  help with rents and flights home to woo Korean workers  Choi added  Guangzhou based Suhu plans to double the number of its South Korean employees to 40  Choi said  It recently hired an executive from Korea s Nature Republic to oversee the recent launch of its Rojank brand  he added  Suhu declined to comment   Chinese brand Proya  which owns the Uzero and Cats   Roses brands  hired South Korean Kim Hoi joon from Clio in 2014 to launch its Hapsode brand  Kim told Reuters  Another former Amorepacific official said Kim had lured him to Proya last year with a salary hike of about 50 percent  He said he was one of over 10 Korean employees hired by Proya  Proya declined to comment  Meanwhile  Jala  one of China s leading cosmetics firms  hired a Korean executive earlier this year to revamp its mainstay Chando brand  two people familiar with the matter told Reuters   Jala also hired the former head of Amorepacific s Etude brand  Kim Dong young  they added  Kim  reached by phone  confirmed he had been working at Jala for about a year  but declined to comment further  Jala s press office was not available for comment   The approach is not limited to cosmetics  Chinese firms from carmakers to flatscreen producers to smartphone vendors have recently opened up more to hiring foreign talent to help them gain a competitive edge  often taking market share from South Korean rivals as they move up the value chain and their industries mature  But Korean brands aren t going down without a fight  Amorepacific said it was working with experts in seven Chinese cities to study local skin characteristics and develop products for the local market   
 It is not that we are not worried about Chinese competition   Rho Jee hye  an Amorepacific senior vice president told Reuters   As there is  Estee Lauder   N EL  in the United States  L Oreal in France and Amorepacific in Korea  an innovative Chinese company could emerge  ",2017-12-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/beauty-contest-china-makeup-brands-rein-in-south-korea-rivals-939379,939379
266314,XOM,Economic Calendar   Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,news,"Investing com   In what is set to be a hectic week  investors will get monetary policy updates from a number of major central banks  with Wednesday s Federal Reserve decision the highlight  The calendar also features trade talks  the U S  jobs report for July  euro zone GDP and another deluge of earnings reports  including from iPhone maker Apple 
Here s what you need to know to start your week 
1             Federal Reserve decision
The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade when it delivers its latest monetary policy decision on Wednesday  Money markets have priced in a quarter percentage point rate cut  after expectations for a half percent cut briefly soared mid month  before pulling back 
The central bank has faced repeated criticism from President Donald Trump over its rate increases and the ongoing reduction of its balance sheet  Trump believes the measures are holding back growth 
That balance sheet reduction  known as quantitative tightening  is set to end in September  but with only a month to go  why wait  Many Fed policymakers are leery of having two policy tools    interest rates and balance sheet size    working at cross purposes 
2             BOE  BOJ meetings
In a busy week for central bank meetings  the Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold at its meeting on Thursday  as policymakers wait for the fog of Brexit to clear 
Investors will be watching for the BOE s assessment of the British economy s current downturn  and how it might respond in the event of a hard Brexit under new Prime Minister Boris Johnson 
Sterling has fallen more than 5  since May  largely on fears of a no deal Brexit  Johnson  less than a week into the job  has already clashed with Brussels after he again called for the withdrawal deal to be rewritten and vowed to take Britain out of the EU on Oct  31 regardless 
The Bank of Japan is also expected to hold steady when it delivers its policy decision on Tuesday  but could reinforce its commitment to keep interest rates at rock bottom  The European Central Bank s decision to hold last week gives the BoJ some breathing room amid a shift to a more dovish stance by central banks worldwide 
3             Trade talks
Trade talks between the U S  and China are due to resume on Tuesday with U S  trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin travelling to Shanghai  Vice Premier Liu He is expected to lead the talks for China 
With Trump s November 2020 re election campaign not in full swing yet and Wall Street at record highs  Trump may not be feeling much pressure for the  big beautiful deal  he has touted but markets will still want something 
The previous round of talks collapsed in May and Trump increased tariffs on  200bn of Chinese imports to 25  from 10  and threatened to slap 25  tariffs on a further  300bn worth of products 
4             U S  jobs report
In a big week for economic data the U S  jobs report for July will steal the spotlight  with a consensus forecast for the economy to add 160 000 jobs  slowing from 224 000 in June  The unemployment rate is expected to tick down to 3 6   while average hourly earnings are forecast to rise 0 2  month on month and 3 2  year on year 
Market watchers will also get updates on manufacturing  trade  pending home sales  personal income and consumer confidence this week  The bulk of the data will come after the Fed meeting and will confirm whether a rate move was necessary as investors try to gauge the monetary policy outlook for the rest of the year 
Elsewhere  euro zone data on Wednesday is expected to show that growth slowed in the in the second quarter  while an inflation report the same day is expected to indicate that inflation remains below the ECB s target of just under 2  
5             Earnings
Investors can look forward to another slew of U S  earnings this week with 170 companies listed on the S P 500 set to report results  including Apple    General Electric    NYSE GE   Spotify  NYSE SPOT   Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   Verizon  NYSE VZ   General Motors  NYSE GM  and ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  
Apple s fiscal third quarter earnings will be in focus as investors wait to see if handset sales have improved  particularly in China amid the ongoing U S  Sino trade dispute  Apple reported that quarterly sales dropped 5  from a year earlier in the previous quarter  largely due to weak growth in China where iPhone sales fell by 17  
The tech giant s services business  which has helped drive profits  will also be closely watched 
Apple s  NASDAQ AAPL  stock price has climbed 33  this year  closing Friday s session at  207 74

296437,TSLA,Tesla driver in fatal  Autopilot  crash got numerous warnings  U S  government,news,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON  Reuters    A man killed in a crash last year while using the semi autonomous driving system on his Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  Model S sedan kept his hands off the wheel for extended periods of time despite repeated automated warnings not to do so  a U S  government report said on Monday  The National Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  released 500 pages of findings into the May 2016 death of Joshua Brown  a former Navy SEAL  near Williston  Florida  Brown s Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the  Autopilot  mode and he was killed  A Tesla Inc spokeswoman Keely Sulprizio declined to comment on the NTSB report  In 2016  the company said Autopilot  does not allow the driver to abdicate responsibility   however  Brown family lawyer Jack Landskroner said in an email the NTSB s findings should put to rest previous media reports that Brown was watching a movie at the time of the crash  which he called  unequivocally false   He added that the family has not taken any legal action against Tesla and was still reviewing the NTSB report  The incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention  but which cannot completely replace human drivers  During a 37 minute period of the trip when Brown was required to have his hands on the wheel  he apparently did so for just 25 seconds  the NTSB said in the report  The report said the Autopilot mode remained on during most of his trip and that it gave him to a visual warning seven separate times that said  Hands Required Not Detected   In six cases  the system then sounded a chime before it returned to  Hands Required Detected  for one to three second periods  Tesla in September unveiled improvements in Autopilot  adding new limits on hands off driving and other features that its chief executive officer said likely would have prevented the crash death  The updated system temporarily prevents drivers from using the system if they do not respond to audible warnings to take back control of the car  The NTSB makes safety recommendations but cannot order recalls  In January  the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  said it had found no evidence of defects in the aftermath of Brown s death  NHTSA said Brown did not apply the brakes and his last action was to set the cruise control at 74 miles  119 km  per hour less than two minutes before the crash    above the 65 mph speed limit  The agency said the truck should have been visible to Brown for at least seven seconds before impact  Brown  took no braking  steering or other actions to avoid the collision   the report said  A Florida Highway Patrol spokesman said the truck driver was charged with a right of way traffic violation  He is due for a court hearing on Wednesday  The NTSB report disclosed that the Tesla Model S uses a proprietary system to record a vehicle s speed and other data  which authorities cannot access with the commercial tools used to access information from event data recorders in most other cars  
For that reason  the NTSB said it  had to rely on Tesla to provide the data in engineering units using proprietary manufacturer software  ",2017-06-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tesla-driver-in-fatal-'autopilot'-crash-got-numerous-warnings---u.s.-government-497036,497036

427762,JPM,Treasury Inversion Is Not About the U S   It Is About the Whole World ,news," Bloomberg     The U S  yield curve is flirting with another broad based inversion again  reigniting Wall Street fears over the fate of the American economy 
A growing chorus of voices is being swayed by another notion  The signal might say more about the state of the world than the U S  business cycle 
Treasuries now make up more than half of all global haven assets  double the share they accounted for during the financial crisis  according to Eurizon SLJ Capital  That complicates matters when long  and short term yields flip  What used to be a reliable American recession indicator is instead an barometer of investors diving for cover worldwide 
It s a narrative that makes a lot of sense as the threat from the coronavirus continues to grow  and it revives the frantic debate from last year about how much predictive power the curve actually has left 
 In a grab for safety and duration  everyone is going for U S  Treasuries   said Gregory Faranello  the head of U S  rates at AmeriVet Securities   The yield curve inversion is a signal now of global growth issues  and not really reflecting what is going on in the U S  
After a respite early last week the curve is once again flattening  and the gap between the rate on 10 Year and 3 Month Treasuries narrowed for a third day on Monday  At the height of coronavirus angst and an equity sell off at the end of last month it briefly inverted for the first time since October 
Bond yields typically rise alongside the duration of debt because they provide compensation for the effects of inflation  If rates on a 10 year note are lower than a three month bill it suggests investors have a pessimistic view of growth and inflation a decade from now 
Stephen Jen  the chief executive officer at Eurizon SLJ  says global hunger for U S  bonds helps explain American exceptionalism in growth  currency markets and stocks 
He predicts that by 2022  U S  government debt will account for two thirds of the world s pool of haven bonds thanks to large issuance and quantitative easing by other central banks  His calculations are based on the outstanding amount of government debt in the U S   Japan  and the three largest European economies  subtracting out the portion that is owned by central banks 
 The U S  might  perversely  thrive because of troubles elsewhere   Jen said in an interview   When U S  Treasury yields fall due to shocks outside of the U S  that may or may not have an impact on the U S  economy  it often provides added stimulus  
It s a view Federal Reserve officials are playing close attention to as global risks from the virus mount  In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday  Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida played down the inversion and said the negative spread is  really driven not so much by an outlook for the U S  economy  but globally   When there s uncertainty money flows to America  he said  so current yield moves don t reflect the U S  outlook 
Campbell Harvey is credited with drawing the link between the slope of the yield curve and economic growth  The professor at Duke University s Fuqua School of Business says corporate America is much more attuned to the yield curve signal and will take preventative action 
 CFOs and CEOs are more aware and aren t likely to take on the risk of just ignoring it   Harvey said   They are being a little more cautious now  
The gap between the yield on three month and 10 year Treasuries recently slipped to as low as about minus 6 basis points  The spread    which has inverted before each of the past seven U S  recessions    had initially fallen below zero in March 2019 as economic conditions deteriorated at the height of the trade war  The spread between two  and 10 year yields  which was negative as recently as September  remains above that mark at about 18 basis points 
Read more  The Yield Curve Is Inverted  Remind Me Why I Care
On Wall Street  strategists at JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Co  still see plenty of reason to fret the slope of the curve  Their favorite indicator    and a part of the curve that remains inverted    is the gap between two year forward and one year forward rates  which can shed light on the bond market s expectations of what the Fed will do 
In this case  it shows a  rising probability of a more protracted Fed rate cut cycle extending to 2021   said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou  a strategist at JPMorgan

278216,AAPL,Citron Turns Bullish  Buy Facebook  FB  Stock In 2019 ,opinion,"Shares of Facebook   NASDAQ FB   surged over 8  Wednesday after Citron Research and Andrew Left raised their price target for the embattled social media powerhouse  citing Facebook s long term appeal  So the question is should investors buy Facebook stock on the dip as we inch closer to 2019 
Citron
Well known short seller Andrew Left of Citron thinks that Facebook stock could reach  160 per share in 2019  The firm pointed out that the company s user data and privacy scandals have had little impact on Facebook s user base and revenues 
Citron and Left dove into just how impressive Facebook s user base is  which should help it continue to attract advertisers as non ad supported platforms such as Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX   and Amazon Prime   NASDAQ AMZN   attract more and more customers  Plus  the firm presented its case as to why Facebook is hardly  evil  compared to many other firms in a report titled    
 Books have been written and movies have been made on the Facebook is evil topic  but never before has Facebook been this compelling of an investment opportunity   Citron wrote 
 As investors have become overly concerned about the short term noise of privacy and propaganda  they have forgotten to look at the earnings power and potential of the most advanced advertising tool with global reach in messaging  networking  and the future of shopping  The Facebook platform has advanced a long way and has turned this research firm from a one time skeptic to a major bull  
Shares of Facebook climbed over 8  to reach  134 18 per share Wednesday after investors reacted positively to Citron calling the social media giant its  2019 S P Stock of the Year   Despite Wednesday s climb  FB stock would have room for roughly 20  growth before it hit Citron s 2019 target 
Furthermore  Facebook stock is still down around 40  from its 52 week high of  218 62  We should also note that other beaten down giants  including Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   and Google   NASDAQ GOOGL    surged as the market tried to rebound from its historically bad December 
Overview 
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other top executives have come under fire over the last year for the company s handling of user information  Facebook has already been fined the maximum legal amount by the UK privacy watchdog and testified in front of members of Congress  Meanwhile  fellow social media firm Twitter   NYSE TWTR   has faced similar scrutiny over its role in the spread of misinformation 
With that said  Facebook could eventually become less of a target as more people understand that what the firm has done with user data isn t necessarily unique  Going forward  other firms and whole industries could draw attention for their use of user data in a digitized world 
Plus  Facebook has already announced it plans to spend billions of dollars in order to curb user data and  fake news  problems  This will impact the company s operating margin that is expected slip into the  mid 30s on a percentage basis  over a more than two year period  But the spending could end up helping Facebook in the long run 
Still  Facebook reaches more than 2 6 billion people across its platforms  and Instagram has become even more popular with users and advertisers  Plus  Facebook plans to jump further into live streaming video and virtual reality  On top of that  FB stock is trading near its all time low forward P E at 16 8X  Facebook has traded as high as 90X over the last five years and 31 5X in the last 12 months  which means it is not too much of a stretch to say FB stock appears  cheap  
Outlook
Looking ahead  our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Facebook s Q4 revenues to surge 26 4  to hit  16 4 billion Q3 revenues jumped 33   Meanwhile  the firm s fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to surge 36 1   Jumping ahead to 2019  Facebook s revenues are expected to climb nearly 24  above our 2018 projection to reach  68 51 billion 
Moving onto the bottom of the income statement  FB s adjusted Q4 earnings are expected to dip slightly from the year ago quarter  FB s fiscal 2018 earnings are  however  still projected to surge 19 6   We should also note that Facebook s fiscal 2019 earnings are projected to slip 0 17  below our 2018 estimate 
With all that said  it seems like Facebook stock could be one to consider heading into 2019 because of its current valuation picture  discount compared to where it has traded in the relatively recent past  and much more 
Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2018-12-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/citron-turns-bullish-buy-facebook-fb-stock-in-2019-200371109,200371109

businesses and staff to other EU cities   But European banks will find it tougher as Brexit comes on top of post financial crisis structural overhauls that their U S  counterparts have largely completed   Since Britain s vote to leave the European Union  some headhunters on Wall Street have reported getting more calls from investment bankers at European groups asking about jobs at their U S rivals   People I ve been in discussion with since the middle of last year have all of a sudden started saying  you were right     I should be more open minded     I don t want to be the last guy here to turn the lights off  Is it too late in the year to move   Gary Goldstein  founder and CEO of executive search firm Whitney Partners in New York  said  Europe s banks were already on the back foot before the vote  focused on cost cutting and shoring up capital while more strongly capitalized U S banks have been able to go out to win new business   We have been getting a number of calls from senior bankers at the European institutions in the U S    Kevin P  Mahoney at Bay Street Advisors  LLC  said   The concerns range from the European banks  inability to lend  and thus compete on deals going forward  to the quickly eroding value of their stock awards and overall compensation    GLOBALLY RELEVANT Some senior executives  worried about the risks of Wall Street dominating the region  argue that Europe needs its own investment banks to service companies at home and abroad and help to spur economic growth    It is in the interests of Europe at large to have a strong  globally relevant bank in Europe   Alasdair Warren  head of corporate and investment banking EMEA at Deutsche Bank told Reuters    If the only globally relevant banks of scale are North American  it s not politically or socially good for Europe  But of course  all institutions  irrespective of geography need to be globally competitive    Barclays   L BARC  chief executive Jes Staley said earlier this year that the region risked tipping over into American dominance  which could leave Europe s capital markets entirely dependent on firms based elsewhere  European companies could also play a role in supporting their home banks  In a research paper in March  think tank Bruegel said companies could help to bolster the continent s investment banks   We recommend that the big European corporates should cherish the  few  remaining European investment banks  by giving them at least one place in otherwise U S   dominated banking syndicates   the paper said    That could help to avoid complete dependence on U S  investment banks   WALL STREET VS THE REST In 2007  the eight biggest European banks  FICC  fixed income  currencies and commodities  revenue was  48 billion  compared with the  38 billion generated by the five biggest U S  banks  according to data from analytics firm Tricumen   Last year  European banks  revenue was  26 billion while U S  banks was  43 billion  In eight years  there has been a  22 billion fall in FICC revenue at European banks and a  5 billion increase at U S  banks  Europe s 26 percent advantage has turned into a 40 percent deficit  European banks  total fee revenue from bond issuance  equity capital markets and mergers and acquisitions  M A  fell from  17 billion to  13 billion between 2007 and 2015  while U S  banks  fees remained unchanged at  23 billion   I would expect European banks to lose more market share to the U S  banks   Darko Kapoor a partner at Tricumen  said   The Wall Street banks potentially face some big Brexit costs   The five largest U S  banks employ around 40 000 people in London  more than in the rest of Europe combined  taking advantage of the EU  passporting  regime that allows them to offer services across the bloc   If they have to set up new continental European outposts this could be extremely costly   It could cost 50 000 pounds   66 215  per person  on average to relocate an employee to the EU  according to consultancy Crossbridge  taking into account the costs of hiring and redundancy  new building  rent and other infrastructure and contingency costs   U S  investment banks have 20 percent more EMEA  Europe  Middle East and Africa  staff in Britain than their European counterparts  according to industry analytics firm Coalition   
 Most banks  U S  and European  have put in place a hiring freeze and are following a  wait and watch  approach  Some banks that had launched restructuring before Brexit are looking at accelerating those programs   Coalition said ",2016-07-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/brexit-widens-chasm-between-wall-street-and-europe's-investment-banks-414974,414974
314106,INTC,How Did Security Stocks Do This Quarter ,opinion,"Security spending is expected to grow in leaps and bounds over the next few years 
IDC estimates that cyber security related services  software and hardware will see around 8 3  CAGR through 2020  This will come off a strong 2016 wherein security services was the strongest category  45  estimates growth   followed by security software  user behavior analytics software being one of the fastest growing sub segments   The U S  is currently the largest market for cyber security  followed by Western Europe 
Gartner says spending on information security will be up 7 6  this year to touch  90 billion and continue growing thereafter to touch  113 billion by 2020  The research firm thinks that spending focus will gradually away from prevention only approaches to detection and response through the forecast period 
Leading Security Software Vendors
Asia Pac is the fastest growing region according to IDC  with Asia Pac excluding Japan seeing 21  growth in 2016 and Japan 16 9   In comparison  the U S  grew just 5 8  and EMEA 6 8   The security appliance market grew 9 7  in 2016 to  11 5 billion 
The top five vendors account for about half the market with others accounting for the rest  Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   is the largest vendor according to IDC with a 15 3  share in 2016 but Checkpoint isn t far behind at 12 8   Palo Alto with 11 8   Fortinet with 9 6  and Huawei with 3 2  round out the top five  Cisco and smaller players ceded share while Checkpoint managed to hold its own 
Market Drivers
There are some very strong secular drivers of this market that should lead to continued increase in demand for years to come 
Given the increase in incidences of hacking  ID theft  the increased sophistication of cybercrime and growing privacy concerns  governments across the world are tightening security regulations for companies and banks leading to a security compliance market  Additionally  government procurement of security solutions is also on the rise as technology is closely linked to national security as well 
The second major driver is the ongoing shift of corporate workloads to the cloud termed cloud computing  The shift  which includes public  private and hybrid environments  is becoming highly complex and leading to many different security situations  some of which may be unique to a given circumstance  This is leading to a cross platform approach to security and the evolution of security as a service 
The shift to cloud computing hasn t reduced the demand for end point security because there are still a large number of organizations and individuals with computing devices  many of which are mobile  Some of these also access the information stored in the cloud  thereby representing points of vulnerability  With the advent of IoT and driverless cars  these end points may be expected to rise dramatically  increasing chances of security threats 
Cost is the only major deterrent to security deployment  since organizations need space  personnel and software  which suck up significant resources  But this is actually opening people up to cloud based software solutions

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings of 36 cents per share on  8 30 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top
Best Buy is focused on enhancing its online business due to increasing threats from online rivals like Amazon
Online sales have maintained double digit gains but only account for 11  of Best Buy s revenue
Consumer electronics retailer  Best Buy  is scheduled to announce first quarter earnings Tuesday morning  Best Buy s business has been significantly impacted lately by online retailers like Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   To remain competitive  the company has enhanced its online business but that has been unable to carry weak earnings  In its Q4 analyst call  Best Buy gave guidance that Q1 revenue could decline between 2 4  and 3 6  with double digit declines coming in international sales  Domestic comparable store sales could also fall as much as 2  
Early indications do not look promising for Best Buy ahead of its earnings  The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings of 36 cents per share on  8 30 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top  This reflects a 5  drop in earnings and 4  decline in sales from a year earlier  It s not surprising that shares are down 11 3  given Best Buy s consistently weak earnings  Fortunately for shareholders  the stock typically increases 4  in the 30 days following results 

Best Buy s biggest problem lately has been the ongoing transition toward its online services  Last quarter and year featured nearly 14  gains in comparable online sales while brick and mortar continues to suffer  Best Buy s move earlier this year to offer same day delivery in major market should bode well for online sales  Currently online sales account for 11  of domestic revenue and as its new initiatives take off  this number should increase
In its brick and mortar stores  the computer and mobile phone categories have been Best Buy s bread and butter  The segment accounted for 46  of revenue followed by consumer electronics was at 36   However  high smartphone penetration coupled with low consumer demand has hurt the company s mobile phone business  Currency headwinds and weak economic conditions have also put pressure on these sectors

288868,AAPL,Traders Ramp Up Expectations Of A May Rate Cut From The RBA,opinion,"The interesting dynamic is how the US tech sector is a growing point of concern right now  while oil is an inspiration and various key central bank meetings are holding back trading activity  Certainly  there has been a pick up in shorting activity on NASDAQ futures  which is always going to happen when Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  come out with poor results  Apple missing consensus EPS  adjusted  for the first time in 13 quarters means we could be facing the worst reaction in the cash market session since January 2013  when it dropped 12    Let s see how Facebook  NASDAQ FB  fare when they report post market tomorrow  but make no bones about it  FB is a brilliant business and I d rather be in Facebook than Twitter any day of the week  Pullbacks into  100 to  90 should be a great opportunity to buy 
One suspects FB earnings will be overshadowed by the April FOMC meeting  although this should be a key affair and the key focal point being whether the Fed re adopt the view that inflation risks are  nearly balanced   I suspect the Fed will not want to rock the apple cart and will want to keep the positive momentum lower in the USD and credit spreads going  Tomorrow s Bank of Japan meeting  however  is a very different beast and one could expect fireworks in the Nikkei and JPY as there are elements of the market expecting a raft of aggressive easing measures and others calling for simply dovish rhetoric  Generally  when we get disagreement  we get volatility  I sit in the  why wait  camp  and hope they throw the kitchen sink at trying to converge with their inflation outlook  although this is a sinking ship and while the sugar hit from markets will be brief  it simply delays the inevitable  We are already staring at the dynamic of the BoJ cornering the equity market  while owning the vast bulk of outstanding Japanese government bonds 
Just take a look at the implied  overnight  volatility in the options markets which sits at the highest since 2010  Clearly traders are expecting a huge move tomorrow 

In Australia  the new news is that we have seen inflation become a major headache for the Reserve Bank of Australia  The fact we have seen headline inflation at 1 3   the lowest since March 2015  and trimmed mean at 1 7   the lowest since Bloomberg started recording the data  now puts the RBA s 2 3  target at risk  There has been an absolute collapse in bond yields  led by the two  and three year part of the curve  Aussie bond futures have seen huge demand  with monster volumes and this is a testament to a market that has been sanguine on future cuts for a while and is now pricing in a 50 50 bet for a May rate cut  This probability was 16  pre inflation release  but although the implied probability has increased I suspect they may want to wait for the Q2 inflation print due on 27 July and may just amend the statement to become more dovish  One must also remember this is a market very long of AUDs as well  with the speculative community running the largest net long position in AUD futures since September 2014 

The fact we have seen iron ore futures fall by the daily limit today is another headwind now for the AUD  so the fact that Chinese authorities are trying to get in front of the moving juggernaut that the Chinese retail trader and the migration into commodity futures suggest there are downside risks to both steel and iron ore futures  AUD USD itself needs to close below  0 7745  yesterday s low  to print a bearish outside day reversal  suggesting a continuation of the downside  however it will also close below the strong bids seen at  0 7695  which can be best seen on the hourly chart 

Certainly from the hourly chart shorts into  0 7680 to 0 7690 look compelling 
I suggested last week now was not the time to go short AUD USD and AUD JPY  but the wind has changed and the trading landscape is changing  With both the Fed and BoJ in play  this could be a dangerous policy to be too short of these pairs anyhow now  but it does seem that the longer term trend resistance at  0 7823 I looked at last week could actually be the high of this move  Westpac announcing they are no longer lending to foreign property buyers seems a big deal as well ",2016-04-27,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/traders-ramp-up-expectations-of-a-may-rate-cut-from-the-rba-200126579,200126579

418250,MYL,StockBeat  Mylan Slumps on Revenue Miss  Strategic Review No Show,news,"Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  slumped on Tuesday after delivering mixed quarterly results and failing to provide an update on its long running strategic review 
Mylan reported first quarter earnings of  0 82 a share  beating estimates from Investing com for earnings of  0 79  but revenue of  2 5 billion missed estimates of  2 7 billion  sending the shares down more than 18   Because of the stock price slump  Mylan shares are now down nearly 16  for the year and are off 46  from their 52 week high 
The company also revealed that attorneys general from several states intend to file a complaint against the drug maker alleging anticompetitive practices concerning some of its generic drugs 
But it s not the first time Mylan has ended up on the wrong side of antitrust laws 
The drugmaker is facing a class action suit over its EpiPen allergy treatment as plaintiffs claim the rebate program  blocked Sanofi  PA SASY  from accessing a significant portion of the market for epinephrine autoinjectors   U S  District Judge J  Paul Oetken ruled late last year 
There was more drama to come as the company  during the post earnings call  said that conclusions from its strategic view should be available in the  near term   after previously announcing last quarter that the review was in the final stages 
That seemingly has sparked speculation among investors that the company is still undecided on the best way forward amid falling sales of generic drugs in North America and slowing sales of its EpiPen 
Analysts have touted three possible options available to drug maker  including a classic restructuring  a leverage buyout or an acquisition or merger 
Sales in North America fell 6  to  922 9 million in the first quarter  primarily driven by changes in the competitive environment and the impact of the Morgantown plant remediation activities   Mylan said 
Yet  there are some on Wall Street who continue to back the drug maker 
 While Q1 sales growth was well below our expectation  we still think 2019 revenue can increase about 5  vs  2018 on strong ramps of generic Advair  biosimilar Neulasta and several other new launches in 2H 2019   said CFRA  the independent research provider 
 We continue to think shares are an attractive value with the low end of 2019  free cash flow  guidance representing a 16  yield on current market cap  and FCF growth expected over the long term

388187,CAT,Why Caterpillar  CAT  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Caterpillar in Focus
Based in Deerfield  Caterpillar  CAT  is in the Industrial Products sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 4 6   Currently paying a dividend of  1 03 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 1   In comparison  the Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry s yield is 1 43   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 87  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  4 12 is up 25 6  from last year  In the past five year period  Caterpillar has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 4 17   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Caterpillar s current payout ratio is 30   This means it paid out 30  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  CAT expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  11 79 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 5 08  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  CAT is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-caterpillar-cat-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200446347,200446347

424128,GM,U S  NAFTA autos negotiator called from Mexico for consultations  officials,news,"By Anthony Esposito and Sharay Angulo MEXICO CITY  Reuters    The U S  negotiator for regional content requirements in autos flew back to Washington from a NAFTA round in Mexico on Monday to talk with car companies  officials said  in a development some hoped would lead to progress on the contentious issue  Four Mexican  Canadian and U S  trade officials said the negotiator  Jason Bernstein  had been called back  with two of the officials saying he was there to meet U S  automakers  Kenneth Smith  Mexico s chief negotiator  told reporters late Monday that Bernstein went to meet U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to talk about the auto sector rules  but he did not comment on the potential meeting with automakers    This does not mean that there has been a rupture or a change of signals from the United States   Smith said  The change in plans disrupted a schedule for talks early in the week about a proposal by the administration of U S  President Donald Trump to make automakers source more from the region and the United States  a major sticking point the industry warns would disrupt supply chains and raise costs  Smith said he hoped the United States could return to talks on regional content rules later this week   Mexican negotiators have said the auto content issue must be resolved in large part between the White House and the Big Three Detroit automakers that dominate the industry   What I ve heard is that he s back in Washington because apparently they are meeting with the Detroit three  If that s the case  that s really positive   said Flavio Volpe  president  of the Toronto based Automotive Parts Manufacturers  Association   The timing is awkward  But if USTR is finally talking to those companies it s something that we ve been asking for months   Volpe said  referring to the United States Trade Representative  USTR   Moises Kalach  head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico s CCE business lobby  said his group understood that Bernstein went to meet with Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co and General Motors Co  NYSE GM    I don t see it as that bad   Kalach told local radio   The important thing will be to see how the issue advances in discussions when we approach the ministerial  meetings  on Saturday and Sunday    U S  trade officials and a Mexican auto industry official in Mexico City said they also believed the fact Bernstein had been called to Washington was a positive development for the talks to renegotiate the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement   A seventh round of talks began on Sunday with the three sides aiming to finish reworking less contentious chapters while also meeting to discuss the trickiest subjects blocking progress to rework the pact that underpins  1 2 trillion in annual trade    We re hopeful to make quite a bit if progress this round  So we ll see how it goes   said Steve Verheul  Canada s chief negotiator as he arrived at the negotiations on Monday  Mexico s government is concerned that a lack of progress on the automotive content issue could hurt the wider renegotiation  a former official still familiar with the process said  Seeking to break the deadlock  the Mexican government has said it would put forward a proposal on rules of origin during the current round of talks  but a Mexican official said on Monday no new ideas had been presented so far   TELEPHONE TROUBLE The renegotiation began last year at the behest of Trump who said the agreement must be overhauled to better favor American interests or Washington would quit the accord  The latest round has been clouded by renewed tension between Mexico and Trump over his planned border wall   Mexico has consistently rejected paying for the wall  and its government had hoped to arrange a meeting between President Enrique Pena Nieto and Trump in the next few weeks  However  a senior U S  official said over the weekend that plan had been postponed after a phone call between the two soured over the wall earlier this month   Mexico s government has not commented officially on the derailment of the Trump Pena Nieto meeting  and Mexico s negotiator Smith said trade talks were still moving forward   The discussions that take place in the media or in other political areas are not affecting the pace or the environment of the negotiations   Smith said   Smith said several chapters are close to being finished  including measures on e commerce  telecommunications and sanitary standards for agricultural products  Others close to the talks believe the energy chapter could also be concluded  Officials do not anticipate major breakthroughs on other intractable issues such as agriculture and dispute resolution mechanisms in the Mexico City round  due to run until March 5  There was little sign of compromise on any issues early on  with a senior Canadian agriculture official pushing back against U S  demands to dismantle Canadian protections for the dairy and poultry sectors known as supply management   
 When it comes to supply management  we believe there can be no concession   said Jeff Leal  the minister of agriculture  food and rural affairs for the province of Ontario ",2018-02-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/negotiators-seek-progress-on-nafta-despite-fresh-trump-tension-1311799,1311799

Xgeva is currently approved for the prevention of skeletal related events  SREs  in solid tumors in patients with bone metastases  With the latest FDA approval  the label of Xgeva will be expanded to include patients with multiple myeloma

259915,BAC,Foreign investors flock to U S  corporate bond market for yield,news,"By Gertrude Chavez Dreyfuss
NEW YORK  Reuters    Foreign investors have had to pay up to hedge U S  dollar denominated assets over the last year  but this has yet to stop them from plowing money into the U S  corporate bond market  the world s largest 
Robust returns for U S  corporate debt assets and expectations of solid U S  economic growth for the remainder of the year have outweighed concerns about costly dollar hedges for many foreign buyers 
A surprise shift in the Federal Reserve s monetary policy stance earlier this year from a tightening bias to a neutral one helped unleash foreign demand for U S  corporate bonds  which have recovered strongly from last year s losses 
The U S  investment grade sector showed total returns of 5 6  so far this year  after a 2 2  loss in 2018  while the U S  high yield market had an 8 3  return  after last year s loss of 2 3   according to the Bank of America corporate bond indexes 
GRAPHIC  U S  investment grade and high yield indexes   
 The much more benign outlook for interest rates has contributed to very sizable returns on fixed income including corporate bonds in the first part of the year   said Hans Mikkelsen  head of high grade credit strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  in New York 
The insatiable appetite for U S  corporate bonds from foreign investors shows no signs of abating 
U S  capital flows data from the U S  Department of Treasury  which has a two month lag  showed net foreign purchases of U S  corporate bonds to the tune of  11 3 billion in the first two months of the year after selling about  15 billion in November and December of 2018 
Another gauge from EPFR Global showed U S  investment grade funds had more inflows than outflows from foreign investors in the January to April period  In contrast  there were more foreign outflows than inflows from June to December last year 
GRAPHIC  Foreign inflows into U S  corporate bonds png   
U S  Treasury yields have come down since the Fed flagged a change in monetary policy  reducing the extra premium investors are willing to pay to hold these bonds instead of safer U S  Treasuries 
U S  corporate bonds are worth less when interest rates rise  When new issues come to market with higher coupon rates than older securities  those older ones become less attractive 
FOREIGNER INVESTORS UNDETERRED
Despite the change in Fed outlook  dollar hedges have remained high  although they re off last year s peaks  stemming from higher dollar borrowing costs in the money markets  That  however  has not deterred foreign investors from buying U S  corporate paper 
 The U S  has been the shining star in the global economy and this is where you re seeing very strong growth and very strong fiscal support over the last year   said Robert Brauns  portfolio manager for multi strategy fixed income at  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  Asset Management in New York 
 I think that has enticed investors to put some more money to work in the U S    he added 
At the same time  foreign investors  rather than face expensive hedging costs  have opted not to hedge their currency risks at all and this has worked to their advantage because the dollar has strengthened  The investor does not only get the yield from the fixed income paper  but the currency gain as well 
European investors buying fixed income debt are still faced with fairly high dollar hedging costs  at around 3 1  using euro three month forwards  slightly lower from the roughly 3 4  in late November 2018  Reuters calculations showed 
Analysts said the net return for a European investor buying U S  high yield debt still comes to 3 1   less the currency hedging cost  In comparison  European high yield has a return of around 3 5  
 If you have the view that the U S  economy is strong and you believe the U S  dollar is going to do well  you re not going to hedge the currency risk   BNP s Brauns said 
Japanese buyers of U S  debt  on the other hand  have seen lower hedging costs this year currently at 2 85   from a peak of 3 25  in November 2018  using 12 month forwards  the BNP official pointed out 
GRAPHIC  Lucrative no more   
Bank of America s Mikkelsen believes hedging costs are on the way down because of the Fed s neutral monetary policy stance 
 Six months ago when you bought U S  corporate bonds  you would be expected to roll into much more expensive currency hedges in 2019  Our market did not look good   said Mikkelsen 
 And now foreign investors could rationally expect cheaper foreign hedges because the market is pricing a rate ease  That s a shift of a hundred basis points between expecting the Fed to hike three times and now an ease   he added 
Japanese investors have thus begun buying foreign corporate bonds again this year  most of it in U S  fixed income debt including Treasuries 
Japanese insurers  in particular  are looking for higher returns abroad by diversifying into riskier corporate bonds in the financial year that began last month 
 Everyone is cognizant of hedging costs  But investors have almost no choice   said Wen Lu  interest rates and volatility strategist  at TD Securities in New York   The demand for yield across all asset classes is something of a necessity for a lot of investors  ",2019-05-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/foreign-investors-flock-to-us-corporate-bond-market-for-yield-1865509,1865509
288944,AAPL,iFOREX Daily Analysis   March 16  2016,opinion,"The dollar held steady against the other major currencies on Tuesday  after the release of downbeat U S  data  as investors returned their attention to the Federal Reserve s policy statement on Wednesday 
The U S  Commerce Department earlier reported that retail sales fell 0 1  last month  and Core retail sales  which exclude automobile sales  declined by 0 1  in February  A separate report showed that the U S  producer price index fell 0 2  last month  and year over year producer prices were flat  Core PPI  which excludes food and energy  was also flat in February  below forecasts for a gain of 0 1   At the same time  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that its general business conditions index improved to 0 6 this month  from a reading of  16 6 in February  below analysts  expectations 
Elsewhere  the yen was boosted after the Bank of Japan made no change to monetary policy  in a widely anticipated decision  as it assesses the economic impact of its decision in January to deploy negative interest rates  The BoJ maintained its  80 trillion base money target and a 0 1  negative interest rate it applies to some reserves  But the Bank also flagged weakness in exports and output due to slowing growth in emerging economies  indicating that more stimulus may be needed in the future 
Today the U K  is to release its latest employment report and the government is to publish its annual budget statement  Canada is to produce data on manufacturing sales and foreign securities purchases  the U S  is to publish report on building permits  housing starts  consumer inflation and industrial production  and New Zealand is to publish data on gross domestic product 
But the main event will be this evening FOMC meeting  when the Federal Reserve is to announce its benchmark interest rate and hold a press conference to outline the factors affecting the monetary policy decision 
EUR USD
The euro inched up on Tuesday in a quiet day of trading  as foreign exchange traders await the release of the Federal Reserve s monetary policy statement for potential clues on the pace of tightening the U S  central bank will embark on for the remainder of the year 
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1 1072 and 1 1125  before settling up 0 06  on the session  The euro closed above 1 11 against the dollar for the fourth consecutive session  Since opening 2016 slightly above 1 085  the euro is up approximately 2 3  against its American counterpart 
Today investors  focus will be on the FOMC meeting  where the Fed is widely expected to leave its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current range between 0 25 to 0 50

WTI Oil
Crude futures fell 2  on Tuesday  extending losses from the previous session  as a monthly report from OPEC provided further signals of a widening gap between supply and demand on energy markets worldwide 
WTI continued to slide  in spite of a slight reduction in OPEC production last month  In its monthly oil market report released on Monday  OPEC said its output decreased by 175 000 to 32 28 million barrels per day in February  mainly due to pipeline disruptions in Iraq and Nigeria  Production in Saudi Arabia  the world s largest exporter of crude  held steady at 10 22 million bpd  Analysts appeared more concerned with the growing imbalance between supply and demand  amid indications for lower than expected refinery demand in Asia during the spring maintenance season and slowing economic outlook in Latin America 
But crude oil prices pointed higher in early Asia on Wednesday after industry data on U S  crude and refined product stockpiles showed a sharp drop in gasoline supplies  The American Petroleum Institute said crude oil stocks rose 471 000 barrels last week  while distillates stock fell 830 000 barrels and gasoline stock dropped 1 2 million barrels

US 500
U S  stocks closed relatively flat on Tuesday  in spite of continued declines in oil prices  as investors remained cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve s release of its latest monetary policy statement following the completion of its March meeting 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0 13   while the NASDAQ Composite index fell 0 45   despite a strong performance from Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  and a host of other major tech stocks 
The S P 500 Composite index  meanwhile  inched down 0 18   as six of 10 sectors closed in the red  Stocks in the Health Care and Basic Materials industries lagged  while stocks in the Technologies and Utilities sectors led

It has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 1 66  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings

Performance and Risk

The ETF has added about 6 93  so far this year and was up about 8 68  in the last one year  as of 12 04 2018   In the past 52 week period  it has traded between  59 26 and  68 21 
The ETF has a beta of 1 01 and standard deviation of 12 31  for the trailing three year period  making it a medium risk choice in the space  With about 200 holdings  it effectively diversifies company specific risk

States and e commerce   International  inclusive of franchise locations in approximately 50 countries  The Health Store and China operations  and Manufacturing Wholesale  comprising manufactured products sold to other segments  third party contract manufacturing and sales to wholesale partners  During the reported quarter  GNC Holdings  revenues from the U S    Canada segment fell 4 5  year over year to  489 2 million  Notably  e commerce sales accounted for 7 4  of U S  and Canada revenues  increasing from 7 1  in the prior year quarter Company owned net store closures negatively impacted revenues by  14 million  Further  a decline of 1 6  in same store sales led to a fall of  6 2 million in revenues within this segment  However  in domestic franchise locations  same store sales increased 0 6  from the year ago period Revenues in the International segment rose 2 1  to  40 9 million for the quarter under review   The improvement can primarily be attributed to an increase in the sales volume in the international franchisees  However  a decline in the sales volume in China due to the transfer of the cross border e commerce China business to the newly formed joint venture  effective Feb 13  2019  partially offset the upside Revenues in the Manufacturing  Wholesale segment registered year over year plunge 37  to  34 7 million  excluding intersegment sales  This

320636,TGT,UPDATE 1 Australia cbank makes inflation the enemy  A  jumps,news,"  RBA minutes show emphasis shifting to inflation
   Keeping rates low for long could create imbalances RBA
   Q3 CPI data on Oct  28 could decide 50 bps hike in Nov
   Aussie jumps to fresh 14 mth highs  1 yr swaps rise
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY  Oct 20  Reuters    Australia s central bank has
identified inflation as its major concern in deciding to raise
interest rates this month from emergency lows  boosting the
local currency and keeping alive chances of a steep hike next
month 
 Minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia s  RBA  Oct  6
policy meeting showed on Tuesday that board members felt it
could be  imprudent  to maintain a very expansionary interest
rate 
 The Australian dollar rose to a fresh 14 month highs while
one year swap rates  jumped to near 11 month peaks
after the minutes were released 
 At the meeting  the central bank raised its key cash rate
to 3 25 percent from a record low of 3 0 percent  surprised
many economists and highlighting the resilience of the local
economy 
 The RBA also indicated it would raise rates further 
leading markets to price in at least two rate hikes before
year end  This month  it became the first central bank among
the Group of 20 to raise rates since signs of global recovery
emerged 
  Overall  if nothing else  these comments confirm our view
that the RBA is going to move to 4 25 percent quite quickly  by
early March next year   said Scott Haslem  chief economist at
UBS 
  The comments reinforce our view that they will probably
lift rates 25 basis points at both the November and December
meetings  and today s minutes certainly don t reduce the risk
the RBA may go 50 basis points in November  
 The RBA minutes noted that downside risks to the domestic
economy had diminished significantly over recent months and
keeping rates low for long could create economic imbalances 
  Keeping interest rates at very lows levels for an extended
period could threaten the achievement of the inflation target
over the medium term   the minutes said 
 Last week  Governor Glenn Stevens said he would not be
timid in removing some of the monetary stimulus put in place to
help the economy ward off the worst of the global financial
crisis 
 He added that the cash rate would be raised to a normal
setting over time 
 ALL EYES ON INFLATION
 The RBA aims to keep inflation in a 2 3 percent band  but
second quarter underlying consumer prices were 3 9 percent
higher than a year ago 
 The market is now focused on the third quarter inflation
report  due on Oct  28  An upside surprise could see investors
increase bets on a 50 basis point hike in November
  They are currently pricing in a 30 percent chance
of such a hike 
  If inflation surprises to the upside there is a material
risk that the RBA will front load the return to neutral cash
rates sooner rather than later   said Annette Beacher  senior
strategist at TD Securities  Singapore   The calls for a 50
basis points hike on Nov  3 will accelerate  including by us  
 Beacher expects RBA s preferred core measures    the
trimmed mean and weighted median    to rise by 0 8 percent
quarter on quarter  leaving it 3 5 percent higher from a year
earlier  That would still be above the RBA s targeted band 
 The RBA board noted underlying inflation was above target
and was likely to bottom out at a level higher than earlier
thought 
  The forecast trough in inflation was not as low as
previously expected  and by 2011 inflation could be rising
again   the minutes showed 
 The board also noted that growth was expected to be around
trend in 2010 and subsequently strengthen  helped mainly by its
strong ties to Asia  Trend growth is considered around 3
percent

389386,NWSA,Frankenstorm And The Oil Patch,opinion,We can call it Frankenstorm And The Oil Patch  because the continuing U S  storm event throws up so many twists and turns in U S  oil and energy and global oil and energy  For oil in particular  we stay logical by noting that the U S  still consumes around 20  of global oil output  and its oil imports although declining still take about 23  of global traded export supply  estimated at a total near 50   52 million barrels day However  from that point on we have the Halloween factor  including unexpected numbers like the ever growing export supply of mostly refined oil products  and some crude  from the U S   where the actual numbers are a complex minestrone soup  What oil traders mostly and firstly trade are ideas  views  opinions  fears and hopes  which the Hurricane Sandy event has supplied in large doses  Early oil analyst newsbytes  or opinion bytes  were that the storm would or could bump up oil prices because it would bump up demand  at least in the U S  Northeast  Within a few days this was disproven by the real world  even if gasoline prices rose due to a mix of factors in no way led or dominated by rising demand and consumption of gasoline  What we will likely find in the U S  is rising inventories led by rising crude oil stocks    because oil demand has declined  The price bump came  of course  but it disappeared faster than a Halloween pumpkin after the party  FRANKENSTEIN ECONOMICS IN EUROPEThe global macroeconomic picture is about as bad for oil prices as any witch could imagine  even in the heartlands of Eastern Europe s Frankenstein country  Europe in 2012  celebrates  its sixth straight consecutive year of declining oil consumption  it only goes down  Arguments that the euro  is a strong currency  can still be heard  and a weak dollar is always good for bidding up oil prices in dollars  but the length of forward time that the  euro    dollar premium  holds up  like the  Brent    WTI premium   is counted  Convergence on a downward tilted playfield is the story going forward Adding up the Three Horrors of the global macroeconomy today    the US fiscal cliff  Europe s ongoing and intensifying recession  and China rebalancing    all of these are bad for oil and almost anything else  At one time  Bernanke had a headstart on others  His QE was the only show in town and had no rivals  but that has completely changed  today  This in fact made it really unimportant who won the recent U S  presidentials   whoever won  the U S  dollar would tend to strengthen and oil prices  and gold prices  would tend to weaken  Europeans were counting on an Obama win  to help rationalize their own massive ECB version of QE featuring the same unbridled money printing effort  targeted at sovereign debt buying  and the economic trick or treat mix of swingeing austerity cures for most  and huge handouts of public cash for some  in the always stricken bank and finance sector across Europe  Why the euro should command a 28  premium on the US dollar is Halloween esque questioning  rather than philosophical   Asking why Brent oil should have a 26  premium on WTI grade oil remains philosophical  but the real world moves on  Even Goldman Sachs has now done its mea culpa  in October  regarding the famous Brent WTI premium  announcing this could shrink to  about  5  by the end of Q1 13  How come these strange premiums and held sway for so long  GEOPOLITICAL HORRORSToday  oil boomers looking and hoping for something that can boost prices  even on a few days only basis  have to scrape around in the geopolitical warchest  Syria s civil war might overflow Syria s borders  possibly triggering a kind of Arab Spring 2 in the Gulf Petromonarchies by Q2 13  Obama  with newfound confidence and cross party support might get back on the Iran bombing trail  also  Anything is possible but these are frail hopes for the oil boomers The real action will come from Russia and Saudi Arabia when crude oil prices have sufficiently shrunk to ring warning bells among Kremlin and Wahabite powerbrokers  the Motley Crue which dominates global oil export price setting    for the moment  The probable outcome is possibly surprising to some  and certainly disappointing to the oil boomers  Both of these secret    and sinister oil price setter powers are likely to accept without serious qualms that oil supply demand fundamentals and global energy fundamentals dictate a New Normal  equilibrium price  for oil of around  75 per barrel for Brent  Lower than that however  they are likely to get irritated or hostile  which both of them know how to do  Also irritated or highly stressed  the CEOs of almost any major Big Energy corporation worldwide will be anxiously looking for the floor price that oil hits on the downside  The stakes are mighty high  below oil prices as high as  75 a barrel    sky high compared with any other form and type of energy    oil exploration and development  E P  spending will go into a tailspin and the heavily overstretched  overleveraged oil sector will be in a very tight financial situation  Prices below about  60 a barrel will make this party nastier than a bad Halloween  for Big Energy producers and oil exporter countries To be sure  none of this might happen  Oil prices might tremble along and down  slowly  as the background noise of news and views continue to rumble  Crash scenarios for prices  we can suggest are possible but are not likely  but the witches are watching ,2012-11-08,Andrew

Targeting the U S  Treasury Market
China is one of the biggest holders of U S  Treasury s  possessing about  1 trillion of bonds in 2017  according to the Federal Reserve  If China chooses to offload its holdings or stop buying new U S  bonds  U S  treasury yields would rise  resulting in a decline in bond prices 
The situation can turn more problematic given the Fed is also on a policy tightening mode and treasury yields are on the higher side this year  iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  ETF   NZ TLT   will come under pressure in such a situation  read    
Higher treasury yields would make new debt issuances for the U S  government costlier  However  chances of such moves are less likely as   it would make China s own holdings lose value and there s  for their dollars   per CNBC

402543,AMZN,Classic  Avoid the Dangers Of Data Mining  Part 2,opinion,Investing StrategiesModels that work well on data about the past may not work in the future Check methods for weak points  like overfitting or ignoring illiquidity or business relationships Keep in mind some practical considerations when testing a theory Other Areas of Data Mining In 1992 1993  there were a number of bright investors who had  picked the lock  of the residential mortgage backed securities market  Many of them had estimated complex multifactor relationships that allowed them to estimate the likely amount of mortgage prepayment within mortgage pools  Armed with that knowledge  they bought some of the riskiest securities backed by portions of the cash flows from the pools  They probably estimated the past relationships properly  but the models failed when no cost prepayment became common  and failed again when the Federal Reserve raised rates aggressively in 1994  The failures were astounding  David Askin s hedge funds  Orange County  the funds at Piper Jaffray that Worth Bruntjen managed  some small life insurers  etc  If that wasn t enough  there were many major financial institutions that dropped billions on this trade without failing  What s the lesson  Models that worked well in the past might not work so well in the future  particularly at high degrees of leverage  Small deviations from what made the relationship work in the past can be amplified by leverage into huge disasters  I recommend   because the first half of the book is very good at debunking data mining  But it also mines data on occasion  In Chapter 9  for example  the authors test methods to improve on buying and holding the index over long periods by adjusting position sizes based off of the results of prior years  Enough results were tested that it was likely that one of them might show something that would have worked in the past  My guess is that the significant results there are a statistical fluke and may not work in the future  The results did not work in the recent 2000 2002 downturn  As an aside  one of the reasons Niederhoffer s hedge fund blew up is that he placed too much trust in the idea that the data could tell him what events could not happen  The market has a funny way of doing what everyone  knows  it can t  particularly when a majority of market participants rely on an event not happening  In this case  Niederhoffer knew that when U S  banks fall by 90  in price and survive  typically they are a good value  Applying that same insight to banks in Thailand demanded too much of the data  and was fatal to his funds  What to Watch Out for Investors who are aware of data mining and its dangers can spot trouble when they review quantitative analyses by looking for these seven signals  1  Small changes in method lead to big changes in results  In these cases  the method has likely been too highly optimized  It may have achieved good results in the past through overfitting the model  which would interpret some of the noise of the past as a signal to return to the earlier analogy  2  Good modeling takes into account the illiquidity of certain sectors of the market  Any method that comes out with a result that indicates you should invest a large percentage of money in a small asset class or small stock should be questioned  Illiquid or esoteric assets should be modeled with a liquidity penalty for investment  They can t be traded  except at a high cost  3  Be careful of models that force frequent trading  particularly if they ignore commission costs  bid ask spreads  and  if you are large enough relative to the market  market impact costs  These factors make up a large portion of what is called implementation shortfall  In general  implementation shortfall often eats up half of the excess returns predicted by back testing  even when back testing is done with an eye to avoiding data mining  For a full description on the pitfalls of implementation shortfall  read   Chapter 10 discusses this issue in detail  This is the best single book I know of on quantitative methods in investing  4  Be careful when a method uses a huge number of screens in order to come down to a tiny number of stocks and then  with little or no further analysis  says these are the ones to buy or sell  Though the method may have worked very well in the past  accounting data are  by their very nature  approximate and manipulable  they require further processing in order to be useful  Screening only winnows down the universe of stocks to a number small enough for security analysis to begin  It can never be a substitute for security analysis  5  Avoid using quantitative methods that lack a rational business explanation  Effective quantitative methods usually come from processes that mimic the actions of intelligent businessmen  Never confuse correlation with causation  Sometimes two economic variables with little obvious financial relationship to each other will show a statistically significant relationship in the past  Two financials merely being correlated in the past does not mean that they will be so in the future  This is particularly true when there is no business reason that relates them  6  Look for the use of a control  A control is a portion of the data series not used to estimate the relationship  It s left to the side to test the relationship after the  best  model is chosen  Often  the control will indicate that the  best  method isn t all that good  And beware of methods that use the control data multiple times in order to test the best methods  That defeats the purpose of a control by data mining the control sample  7  One of the trends in accounting is to make increasingly detailed rules in an attempt  wrongheaded  to fit each individual company more precisely  The problem with that is it makes many ratios difficult to compare across companies and industries without extra massaging to make the data comparable  This makes thinning out a stock universe via screening to be less useful as a tool  For quantitative analysis to succeed  the data need to represent the same thing across different firms  Practical Recommendations There are many pitfalls in quantitative analysis  But three simple considerations will help protect investors from the dangers of data mining  1  Paper trade any new quantitative method that you consider using  Be sure to charge yourself reasonable commissions  and take into account the bid ask spread  Take into account market impact costs if you are trading in a particularly illiquid market  Even after all this  remember that your real world results often will underperform the model  2  Think in terms of sustainable competitive advantage  What are you bringing to the process that is not easily replicable  How does the method allow you to use your business judgment  Is the method so commonly used that even if it is a good model  returns still might be meager  Even good methods can be overused  3  If doing quantitative analysis  do it honestly and competently  Form your theory before looking at the data and then test your theory  Then  if the method is a good one  apply the results to your control  If you perform quantitative analysis this way  you will have fewer methods that seem to work  but the ones that pass this regimen should be more reliable ,2013-04-16,David Merkel,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/classic:-avoid-the-dangers-of-data-mining,-part-2-163084",163084

354759,LMT,3 Stocks To Buy On Strong GDP Data And Interest Rate Cut ,opinion,"The S P 500 closed at a record high Wednesday as third quarter GDP rose 1 9   beating estimates of 1 6   The better than expected rise in domestic GDP was led by consumer  government  and residential spending as consumer expenditures continue to prolong the longest economic expansion on record  Consumers purchased big ticket items such as automobiles and the government ramped up its defense spending 
Hours after the GDP report s release  the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point  to a range between 1 50  and 1 75   and began to play down expectations for further cuts  Let s take a look at a few stocks that investors can consider as the domestic economic expansion continues its record run 
Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   has continued to secure big defense contracts from the Pentagon that helped bolster its third quarter report  the company saw its bottom line grow 10  and its top line pop 6   Some of those notable contracts include a  2 4 billion contract to procure initial spares for the F 35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter jets and a  492 1 million contract for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems  HIMARS  M142 launchers 
Lockheed Martin also secured a  2 7 billion contract from NASA to build at least three Orion spacecraft for use in its Artemis program to return astronauts to the moon by 2024  The big contracts the aerospace giant has lined up  paired with the way the government has ramped up its defense spending  should keep revenue coming in for years to come 
Our fiscal 2019 estimates project the company s earnings to climb 22 63  to  21 57 per share and for net sales to reach  59 19 billion for a 10 1  leap  LMT sports a respectable 2 37  dividend yield and is listed as a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Group 1 Automotive   NYSE GPI   is a solid play to make as consumer spending on automobiles remained strong in the third quarter  The automotive retailer has seen its shares climb a whopping 92 8  in 2019 thus far  outperforming the automotive retail market s impressive 51 3  YTD run  Group 1 Automotive regularly acquires and divests dealerships and franchises to expand its business 
In July  the company acquired five new U K  franchises  After the U K  expansion  the company plans to fortify its presence in the United States  but for the short term  it aims to acquire attractive businesses in the US that can provide growth opportunities  Group 1 Automotive s strong business execution of used vehicles drove the company s top line up 7 9  and its bottom line up 11 03  in Q3  Fiscal 2019 figures estimate EPS to come in at  10 40 for a 16 72  climb and net sales to reach  11 89 billion for a 2 48  rally 
On top of the company s stellar performance in 2019 and strong growth trajectory  the stock is currently trading at a discounted forward multiple relative to the industry average  The firm s P E of 9 9X provides a solid entry point to a company that has been reaping the benefits of the strong demand for automobiles  GPI s earnings estimates have been revised higher  earning the stock a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Bluerock Residential Growth   NYSE BRT   is a REIT that acquires apartment properties in demographically attractive growth markets throughout the United States  The housing sector was a tailwind for growth as residential investment rose at a 5 1  annual pace  The boost  which followed six straight quarters of declines  likely reflected lower short term interest rates propelling construction and improvements  The Federal Reserve s decision to cut interest rates for the third time this year should be an additional tailwind for the housing sector and especially REITs who can refinance debt and use the extra cash to expand its operations in the low rate environment 
Bluerock Residential boasts a juicy 5 46  dividend yield that has been steadily raised over the past five years  and also sports a beta ratio of 0 36 that can fortify a portfolio against potential macroeconomic volatility  This stock also trades at a forward multiple below the industry average  which makes it an opportune time to snatch up a stock that has seen its shares rise 46 5  YTD 
Our Q3 consensus estimates call for FFO to gain 5 56  to  0 19 per share and for revenue to jump 11 81  to  53 5 million  Fiscal 2019 figures estimate BRT s FFO to increase 11 11  to  0 80 per share and revenue to spike 14 95  to  212 33 million  The REIT has an average FFO surprise of 14 73  over the past four quarters and sits at a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

269532,KO,3 Top Dividend Stocks To Maximize Your Retirement Income   November 06  2019,opinion,"Here s an eye opening statistic  older Americans are more afraid of running out of money than of death itself 
Also  retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned  since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses  Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living  pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies 
The tried   and   true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn t work today 
For example  10 year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6 50   which translated to an income source you could count on  However  today s yield is much lower   currently under 2  and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements 
That means if you had  1 million in 10 year Treasuries  the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than  1 million 
In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields  today s retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits  Because of certain demographic factors  it s been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035 
Unfortunately  it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income   bonds and Social Security   may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees  But what if there was another option that could provide a steady  reliable source of income in retirement 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
As a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds  and other bond options   we believe dividend paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable  predictable income investors in retirement seek 
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
Going beyond those familiar names  you can find excellent dividend paying stocks by following a few guidelines  Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3   with positive annual dividend growth  The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
Foot Locker  NYSE FL  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 38 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 31   This compares to the Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 85   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 52 is up 10 14  from last year 
Invesco  IVZ  is paying out a dividend of 0 31 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 6 84  compared to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 2 52  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 24 is up 3 33  from last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 19 per share  Manulife Financial  MFC  has a dividend yield of 3 95   This is compared to the Insurance   Life Insurance industry s yield of 0 55  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 76 is up 12 04  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
Overall  that is true  But stocks are a broad class  and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high quality dividend stocks that can generate regular  predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market 
Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend paying stocks  Here s why  many of these stable  high quality companies increase their dividends over time  which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
If you re interested in investing in dividends  but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks  beware of fees  Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees  which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends  undercutting your dividend income strategy  Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach 
Bottom Line
Regardless of whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  looking for a steady stream of income from dividend paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement 
Generating income is just one aspect of planning for a comfortable retirement

284187,AAPL,General Electric s  13 Billion Deal For French Industrial Giant,news,"By    General Electric Co   NYSE GE  is poised to make its biggest ever acquisition  but the proposed deal is just as likely to draw brickbats from critics of American corporate tax policy as it is kudos from investors 
The U S  conglomerate could announce a deal to buy French industrial company Alstom  PARIS ALSO  for  13 billion in coming weeks  according to Bloomberg News  That could spark a public relations headache for the Fairfield  Conn   company  as it is likely to fund the deal from its estimated  57 billion cash hoard kept overseas to avoid U S  taxes  The Alstom deal could also see regulatory scrutiny from the French government 

GE has long been criticized for its light tax burden  Between 2002 and 2011  it paid an estimated average tax rate of just 1 8  GE s strategy of keeping cash offshore mirrors moves by other U S  companies such as Apple Inc   NASDAQ AAPL  and Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE  
 This  overseas  money is available to fund the operations of our non U S  subsidiaries   GE spokesman  Seth Martin  told International Business Times in an email 
The company s 2013 annual report  notes that if overseas cash were repatriated  GE would face more in U S  income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
 GE s effective tax rate is reduced because active business income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside the United States is taxed at less than the U S  rate   according to the company s annual report 
In the U S   corporate tax rates can reach up to 35 percent  but General Electric paid just 4 2 percent tax on its operating earnings last year  down from 28 5 percent in 2011  partly thanks to  global funding structures  
Last year  GE made more than  1 billion in revenue from each of at least 24 countries  though nearly half of its revenue usually comes from the U S 
The Alstom deal comes as a surprise given GE CEO Jeff Immelt s promise earlier this year to favor acquisitions of under  4 billion  The deal isn t yet official  but an announcement could come as early as next week  sources cited by Bloomberg said 
GE has worked to wind down its nonindustrial operations  especially its financial arm GE Capital  The company has also sought to boost its industrial businesses  which sell energy  mining and locomotive equipment to businesses and governments  The proposed acquisition echoes that theme and comes amid GE s planned spinoff of its consumer finance arm  expected later this year 
Alstom  a top maker of energy and rail equipment  saw 14 5 billion   20 1 billion  euros in sales over the past nine months of 2013  though its shares have performed poorly in the past few years   About two thirds of its revenue comes from power related sales  with transportation and grid equipment ranking second and third in importance  respectively 
Some analysts  such as Sanford C  Bernstein s Steven Winoker  lauded the deal in an interview with Bloomberg  calling it   among the best fits we have seen with the GE portfolio for some time  
At this point  it remains unclear just how much the two companies could save by merging operations  Both have significant overlaps in the industrial equipment segment  though GE s train business has focused on commercial freight  while Alstom sells passenger rail cars 
In a statement Wednesday  Alstom said that it wasn t aware of any potential public bids  The company said that its shareholder could receive an update when it reports annual results on May 7  GE declined to comment  Since Immelt became GE s CEO in 2001  the company has complete  more than 200 takeovers   Bloomberg reported ",2014-04-24,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/general-electric’s-$13-billion-deal-for-french-industrial-giant-279609,279609
269564,KO,3 Large Cap Dividend Stocks To Buy After Fed Cuts Interest Rates For Second Time,opinion,"Markets have climbed back in September after a rough and volatile August  Despite the comeback  which has the S P 500 near its highs  fears of a global economic slowdown remain  These worries  coupled with the uncertainty from the ongoing U S  and Chinese trade war prompted the U S  Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate for the second time since July on Wednesday 
The Fed concluded its two day policy meeting early Wednesday afternoon and announced that it voted to drop interest rates by 25 basis points to between 1 75  and 2   Wall Street and traders had largely priced in this rate cut  which the U S  central bank made to help boost a slowing U S  economy and fight off broader worldwide fears  Overall  seven out of 10 officials voted to cut the short term benchmark rate 
Looking ahead  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell remains committed to his seemingly more pragmatic approach  as U S  consumer spending remains strong  This means additional rate cuts are not guaranteed  even though many  including President Trump  have pushed for larger cuts  Trump tweeted shortly after the announcement   Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again  No  guts   no sense  no vision   A terrible communicator  
Trump and others have cited negative interest rates in countries such as Germany and Japan  as reason enough for the Fed to take a more dovish tone  Nonetheless  yields on the 10 year U S  Treasury sat at roughly 1 78  through late afternoon trading 
With this in mind  we looked for strong  stable companies  We then added a dividend yield above the current 10 year U S  Treasury s payout to our criteria using the to help investors find stocks that look like solid buys given our current rate environment and economic picture   
1  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  
Lockheed Martin  like all three companies on this list  needs little preamble  The firm posted impressive second quarter 2019 results  which included a record  137 billion backlog  and upped its full year guidance across all financial metrics  The Bethesda  Maryland based global security and aerospace company is also set to benefit from increased U S  government spending on next generation technology  such as hypersonic missiles  Shares of LMT have soared 51  in 2019 to crush its industry s 31   Northrop Grumman   NYSE NOC    General Dynamics   NYSE GD    and others  average climb  as well as Boeing s   NYSE BA   19  
LMT is trading at 16 4X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus earnings estimates  which marks a discount against its industry s 18 8X and its own three year median of 19 7X  Along with its solid valuation  our estimates call for the firm s adjusted full year fiscal 2019 earnings to pop 20 5  on 10 3  higher revenue 
The company s 2020 EPS figure is then expected to come in 18 3  above our 2019 estimate  on 4 4  stronger sales  Lockheed Martin has also seen some strong earnings estimate revision activity recently to help it earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Lastly  LMT currently pays an annualized dividend of  8 80 per share  for a 2 23  yield that rests firmly above the 10 year U S  Treasury note s 1 78  
2  Procter   Gamble   NYSE PG  
Procter   Gamble is one of the world s largest makers of household goods  from Febreze and Swiffer to Head   Shoulders and Pampers Fabric   Home Care accounts for 33  of sales  with Baby  Feminine   Family Care making up 27   The consumer packed goods powerhouse has kept pace with the broader market over the last three years  despite facing encroachment from upstart and digital first brands that have grabbed market share in the Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and social media age  where consumers now shop directly from Instagram   NASDAQ FB    Nonetheless  Procter   Gamble continues to innovate and find new revenue streams  which includes a chain of Tide branded dry cleaners 
PG shares have soared 45  during the last 12 months  against its industry s 25  climb and the S P 500 s 2   This makes its 2 46  dividend yield all the more impressive since it is not artificially inflated by a falling stock price  With that said  Procter   Gamble s outsized climb has stretched its valuation a bit  but PG stock still trades in line with its industry in terms of forward P E 
Looking ahead  PG s fiscal 2020  current year  and 2021 revenues are projected to pop 4  and 3 4   respectively  Meanwhile  the firm s full year earnings are expected to climb 7  this year and 6 3  above our 2020 estimate next year  Procter   Gamble is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that also rocks an  A  grade for Growth in our Style scores system 
3  Coca Cola   NYSE KO  
Coca Cola is the most well known name on this list and is one of the most recognizable brands in the world  The soft drink giant came in at  on Forbes  most valuable brands list  behind only tech names such as Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   and Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    KO raised its full year organic revenue outlook last quarter  and its non sugary segment has grown at an impressive clip  The company is also poised to expand through acquisitions and investments  This includes its purchase of potential Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   rival Costa Coffee and investment in Gatorade   NASDAQ PEP   rival BodyArmor 
The Atlanta based firm also recently rolled out of its first energy drink under the Coca Cola brand  KO shares are up 17  in the past 12 months and 28  over the last three years  which comes in well above the Beverages Market s 7  climb  Similar to PG  KO s valuation picture is a tad extended right now as its shares rest near their 52 week highs 
Yet  Coca Cola s forward P E remains just above its industry s average  where it almost always trades  Coca Cola s growth outlook appears strong and its longer term earnings estimate revision activity helps the stock hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  at the moment  Along with its  B  grade for Growth  KO boasts the highest dividend yield on the list at 2 95  
Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices  In the process  it s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3 trillion in activity A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech  Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s  Zacks  just released special report reveals 7 stocks to watch  The report is only available for a limited time ",2019-09-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-largecap-dividend-stocks-to-buy-after-fed-cuts-interest-rates-for-second-time-200465916,200465916

425362,GM,Chongqing blazes economic trail as Bo scandal recedes,news,"By Sue Lin Wong CHONGQING  China  Reuters    The economic success of the metropolitan area of Chongqing in central China was in the balance following the jailing four years ago of its charismatic Communist Party chief Bo Xilai  a rising star in the political elite      But the city has continued to thrive  a feat that has some lessons for other local governments and reflects a pragmatic streak in China s leadership in allowing Bo s Chongqing model  and his economic adviser  Mayor Huang Qifan  to survive his fall      China is trying to transform its giant economy from one led by basic manufacturing to one more reliant on services and consumption  which the government expects to provide more stable growth in the future  A slowdown in growth and slumping stock markets in the past year have raised concerns among investors about Beijing s ability to maintain stability while driving structural reforms  Chongqing appears to have achieved that balance  Unlike much of China  it didn t shirk the hard decisions  opting early to cut overcapacity in its steel industry and investing heavily to move up the value chain from lower end manufacturing to electronics  biomedical products and high tech equipment  Under Bo  Chongqing became one of China s fastest growing regions  helped by a crackdown on corruption  corporate tax breaks  the pursuit of foreign investment  and rapid urbanization and industrialization  And so it remains  chalking up growth of 11 percent in 2015  while the national economy slowed to a 25 year low of 6 9 percent  While Beijing purged many of Bo s associates  Huang was left in office to oversee that success under new city party boss  Sun Zhengcai  a man tipped for top national leadership  Even so  the scandal briefly threatened Chongqing s economic future  Local government official Le Peng said business activity and foreign investment declined  and projects initially approved for Chongqing were moved elsewhere   The Bo Xilai incident had a very large impact on Chongqing s economy   he said  speaking from an office in the city s Liangjiang New Area  Chongqing was blessed with advantages before Bo and Huang  from its handy location on the Yangtze River and arms manufacturing history in the 1940s  to central government s decision to make it the fourth municipality in 1997  alongside Beijing  Shanghai and Tianjin  in a push to develop inland regions  But it didn t rest on its laurels   I think we can learn from Chongqing s experience about the importance of undertaking industrial upgrading and restructuring   said Yating Xu  an economist at IHS in Beijing  CHINA MOTOWN Policies included a corporate income tax at 15 percent to develop priority industries in China s west compared with 25 percent in more developed parts of China  the first tax bonded area in inland China  so importers didn t pay duties until they sold products on  incentives for investing in high tech and green industries  reforms to encourage rural workers into the city  and policies to make more land cheaply available to industry  The city is now one of the country s leading centers of automobile manufacturing  drawing global brands such as Hyundai  Iveco  General Motors  NYSE GM  and Ford  One of China s biggest carmakers  Chongqing Changan Automobile  which plans to sell 4 5 million vehicles by 2020  is based there   Huachen Xinyuan s new auto plant  which primarily supplies China s domestic market  is based in nearby Fuling district   once a six hour boat ride from Chongqing center but now just 40 minutes by high speed train  That in turn attracted businesses like Haoxiang Machinery   We moved out here to be closer to Huachen Xinyuan  along with 14 other component suppliers   said Ye Huagang  its boss  over the buzz of jackhammers at his new factory  Global electronics brands including Hewlett Packard  Foxconn  Acer and Asus all have operations in Chongqing  lured by tax breaks  cheap labor and land  plus a developed supply chain and logistics  The region makes one in three of the world s laptops  The vigor of the manufacturing sector has also helped develop related technology clusters and attendant finance and logistics services   There s a very close connection between the development of manufacturing and services   said Tu Xingyong  chief economist at Chongqing s Economic and IT Commission  Chongqing hasn t just been successful at attracting inward investment  Chongqing firms are also outbound investors  and consular representatives from 10 countries are based there   We are here mainly to attract Chinese companies who want to invest in Ethiopia and Africa   said Kebede Abera  Ethiopia s consular general to Chongqing  In the past four years  around 80 Chinese companies have visited Ethiopia  and some  including Chongqing carmaker Lifan and Chongqing Bureau of Geology and Mining Exploration  have invested there  POLITICAL PROMISE Fears that Chongqing might suffer for its connection with Bo  who some had considered a potential rival for leadership in Beijing  were soothed when President Xi Jinping made his first trip of 2016 to the city   This place is full of promise   he said in a speech looking out over a port connecting railways  waterways and roads along China s new Silk Road linking Asia and Europe  That is in part a political calculation   If Chongqing s economy slowed down  the outside world would think Chongqing can t do without Bo   a source with ties to the leadership said  As a further sign of favor  Mayor Huang was among half a dozen regional officials picked to join Xi on his visit to the United States last year  Huang s next role could well take him to the national stage  Two sources say he is tipped to become secretary general of the cabinet  which would make him Premier Li Keqiang s right hand man   The power he has here  even if it is local  it s a very national level experiment   said Sergio Maffettone  Italy s consul general to Chongqing   Chongqing is like a lab for reforms

410130,NEM,VanEck Shares Paulson s Concerns on Newmont Goldcorp Merger,news," Bloomberg     Paulson   Co  isn t the only  Newmont Mining  Corp  NYSE NEM   shareholder that s expressing concerns over the terms of the gold miner s  10 billion purchase of Goldcorp Inc 
 I think Paulson has a valid point   said Joe Foster  a portfolio manager at VanEck    one of the biggest Newmont shareholders  When the deal was inked  investors were unaware of the  outrageous payouts  that would be given to Goldcorp executives after the merger  he said 
On top of that  it s unfair that Goldcorp shareholders should benefit from a joint venture between Newmont and Barrick Gold Corp  in Nevada  given that was negotiated after the Goldcorp Newmont terms were set  he said 
Mounting investor concerns sent Goldcorp shares tumbling as much as percent in New York  while Newmont pared losses and rose as much as 1 4 percent 
On Thursday  Paulson said it won t support Newmont s proposed merger with Goldcorp unless the terms are changed  Paulson said a 23 percent reduction in the value of the transaction would help ease his concerns because under the current deal  Goldcorp shareholders are effectively receiving the benefits of the recently announced joint venture for free 
 Aggressive  Analysis
 I think Paulson s analysis might be aggressive  but I think directionally they have the right idea   Foster said in a telephone interview Friday   I don t think shareholders should support the lavish lifestyles of the Goldcorp executives for one thing  And secondly  Goldcorp shareholders are not entitled to the JV synergies because it was not part of the deal  
Shareholders including VanEck had previously blasted the increase in Goldcorp Chairman Ian Telfer s retirement allowance to roughly  12 million from  4 5 million if the company completes its merger with Newmont  Initially  the plan was for Telfer to join Newmont s board as deputy chairman  But earlier this month  Goldcorp announced he wouldn t accept the new job 
British Columbia Investment Management Corp   which holds 3 85 million shares in Goldcorp and a small stake in Newmont  said Friday it would vote against the merger partly because of the payment that would go to Telfer   This is inconsistent with the governance principle of pay for performance and sets a troubling precedent in the capital markets   BCI said in a statement 
 We just received the letter and are evaluating it   Omar Jabara  a Newmont spokesman  said Thursday by email  referring to Paulson s concerns  Newmont didn t respond to requests for comment Friday  The miner has previously said a merger with Goldcorp would create more than  4 4 billion in value  The combined company would be the world s largest gold miner  with sustainable production of 6 million to 7 million ounces a year 
Foster said he has not yet decided whether he will vote for the deal  VanEck held 5 9 percent of Newmont shares and about 6 2 percent of Goldcorp shares outstanding at the end of 2018  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  At Thursday s closing prices  that Newmont stake would is valued at  1 08 billion versus  596 4 million for the Goldcorp stake 
Newmont investors who held shares as of the Feb  20 record date will be allowed to vote on the merger on April 11  according to Newmont s proxy materials  A spokesman for Paulson said the hedge fund acquired 14 2 million shares this year but declined to comment on whether they were purchased before or after the record date 
April 4 Vote
Goldcorp shareholders are scheduled to vote on the deal April 4  Paulson sold its entire position in Goldcorp in 2019 for the reasons explained in the statement  the spokesman said  According to data compiled by Bloomberg  Paulson held about 800 000 shares of Goldcorp at the end of 2018 
Greenwood Village  Colorado based Newmont s offer was made just months after Goldcorp shares hit their lowest level since 2002 
The tie up was also harshly criticized by Barrick during a hostile bid for Newmont in the past month  which has since been withdrawn in favor of the joint venture between the two companies  Barrick CEO Mark Bristow said he didn t believe the Newmont Goldcorp combination created any value and called Goldcorp s assets  less than attractive  
Under the current terms  Newmont would create more value by not merging  once the joint venture with Barrick is created  Paulson said  It also flagged  remarkably  divergent fourth quarter results for both Newmont and Goldcorp  announced after the merger  The premium is  unjustified  given Vancouver based Goldcorp s poor performance  the hedge fund said 
 I m not going to prescribe what the company should or shouldn t do   Foster said   I m sure Newmont is looking at all the options and I m sure Newmont wants to do what s fair for shareholders  ",2019-03-22,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/vaneck-shares-paulsons-concerns-on-newmontgoldcorp-merger-1815775,1815775

While the fixed income world is inherently conservative  the ease and low cost of ETFs is rapidly wooing converts  Worries that stocks have reached their peak  continued uncertainty over the direction of U S  interest rates and rampant geopolitical risks have bolstered demand    especially as traders find more and more innovative ways to strategically use these products 
 Investors are seeing the efficiencies that can be found using the ETF vehicle   said Kevin Flanagan  head of fixed income strategy at WisdomTree Investments Inc  In finance   typically you see equity folks take the lead and bond guys follow  and that s continued  
Liquidity concerns that have plagued the sector since its inception seem to be fading  While anxiety about a potential mismatch between the liquidity of a fund and its underlying securities hasn t disappeared  bond ETFs seem to be inspiring more confidence as time goes on and they endure market fluctuations 
Fixed income funds currently make up about 20  of the  4 4 trillion U S  ETF market  but a BlackRock Inc  NYSE BLK   report from June suggests assets could explode to more than  2 trillion globally over the next few years 
In Europe  bond ETFs attracted more money than stock funds for the first time in three years in 2019  data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show  Flows into debt ETFs almost doubled in Australia  and Taiwan s ETF market surged thanks to interest from life insurers 
 There s a huge wave of wealth retiring  and bonds are traditionally the safe haven asset that preserves wealth   said Will McGough  chief investment officer of retirement strategies at Stadion Money Management 
Overbought Stocks
By contrast  even with the S P 500 Index continuing to beat records  many are wondering how long the bull market in U S  equities    now entering its 11th year    can last 
Technical indicators suggest stocks have been overbought for much of the past three weeks  while an RBC Capital Markets survey of institutional investors in December found the fewest people describing themselves as  bearish  since the third quarter of 2018  just before the S P s 19 8  rout 
In addition  the onslaught of diverging headlines about U S  and China trade talks and Brexit negotiations have given investors whiplash  while growing tensions with Iran may reignite a search for havens  Throw in mixed economic data from countries around the world and it s little wonder that bonds remain attractive to many 
 There s increasingly concerns we re in late cycle   said David Perlman  ETF strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management   If we are  fixed income can help to buffer some of the risk of equities  
Nifty Uses
But these traditional allocations could be just the tip of the iceberg  Adding to the popularity of fixed income ETFs is a spurt of creativity in how they can be used 
Banks are employing bond ETFs to facilitate portfolio trades that allow investors to seamlessly move large numbers of bonds on and off their balance sheets  Other users are relying on fixed income ETFs as a hedge  to earn returns on money they re waiting to allocate elsewhere  or as a tool to adjust their portfolios 
It helps that the fee compression wave sweeping the ETF industry has made fixed income strategies cheaper than ever  For instance  BlackRock   State Street  Corp  NYSE STT   and  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  AG s DWS Group all slashed the costs of their high yield debt funds in 2019  That trend is likely to spread in 2020  further bolstering ETF demand 
 Transaction costs in fixed income bonds can be sizable  but in ETFs  they re relatively low   said Matt Bartolini  managing director at State Street Global Advisors   As we continue to have these risk events and the structures continue to be tested  that s just going to lead to more people becoming more comfortable with the structure  ",2020-01-07,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/bond-etfs-come-of-age-after-150-billion-year-heralds-new-order-2054306,2054306

365986,MAS,USD SGD  Singapore Growth Forecast Cut But 1 258 Holding,opinion,The latest Survey of Professional Forecasters done quarterly by Central Bank Monetary Authority of Singapore  MAS  showed that analysts expect a growth of only 2 3  for GDP in 2013  slightly lower than the high end of MAS s own estimate of 1 3  and half a percentage point lower than the previous median estimate of 2 8   Inflation outlook has also improved  with CPI expected to rise by only 2 8  this year  much lower than the previous quarter 3 8  median and below MAS s own estimated range of 3 4  Assuming that the private economists are correct  will a 2 3  be disconcerting for MAS  It is unlikely as this figure is still above the mid range of MAS s projection  which should make MAS feeling generally comfortable  However  there is a tendency for MAS to  under promise  and  over deliver  in its projections  as it is historically found to do  If this is true  then perhaps the decline in consensus estimate may start to ring alarm bells for MAS  as it indicates that Singapore s economy is actually under performing compared to previous estimates  with further slowdown potentially waiting in the next half of 2013 MAS may comfort in the fact that the 0 5  fall in GDP estimate is accompanied by a 1 full percentage point fall in inflation  This would actually increase its scope to weaken SGD which it is currently hesitant to do so due to the high inflation rates plaguing Singapore right now  However  even with the expected decline in CPI  the revised numbers are still higher than historical average  Furthermore  inflation is expected to pick up once more to 3 1  in 2014 based on current data  which means MAS will be potentially risking higher inflation in 2014 if it choose to weaken SGD right now for the sake of the economy   which is still within MAS comfort level  Hence the likelihood of any change in SGD NEER policy  which is on a  modest and gradual  appreciation is low and it is highly likely that MAS will maintain current curve for SGD during October s meeting Hourly ChartThis did not stop SGD from weakening during early Asian trading session though  sending price up to 1 258 after the capitulation of USD yesterday brought about by US stock decline  The weakening of SGD wasn t severe  as price quickly reversed during early European hours from the technical bounce off the aforementioned level  Stochastic readings have formed a peak similar to the one found yesterday  and a bearish cycle seems likely from here out  with 1 252 1 254 interim support zone currently under threat  Should the lower end 1 252 gets broken  1 24 round figure may open up as a plausible bearish target  but that is a long way from here and it is likely that price may stall along any of the interim support lines especially if Stochastic readings hit Oversold Daily ChartUSD SGD 2  width  580  height  402  Longer term chart leans towards a weaker SGD  but current bullish outlook  rally since Jan 2013  is under threat with the possibility of price breaking back into the 1 2525 1 243 consolidation range  The failure to push above 1 26 may undo all the good bullish work of the Tweezers Bottom found on 6th and 7th Jun and bearish acceleration may occur should price start to trade below the 2nd candle of the  3 White Soldiers  pattern that extended the 1 243 rebound  Stochastic readings suggest that a bearish cycle may be in play soon  which may line up nicely in conjunction with a 1 2525 break  but caution should be practiced as price may bounce higher from 1 2525 which will validate broader uptrend and also the rebound from 1 243 ,2013-06-12,Mingze Wu,https://www.investing.com/analysis/usd-sgd:-singapore-growth-forecast-cut-but-1.258-holding-171060,171060

310651,NFLX,Wall Street faces profit recession as earnings season begins,news,"By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK  Reuters    Wall Street s fourth quarter earnings season that gets under way next week could confirm something many investors may not want to hear  the U S  economy may be doing well but corporate profits are in a recession  An earnings recession   two quarters of declining profits   would be led by the usual suspects  energy and materials companies  But its severity may depend on consumer discretionary companies  which have been warning about profits at an unusual pace  Consumer discretionary companies  which led S P 500 gains in 2015 and have had the second highest average profit growth rate of any sector over the last five years  are more pessimistic than usual going into the quarter  That is despite the benefit of lower gasoline prices for consumers  Consumer discretionary stocks rose 8 4 percent last year  thanks in large measure to Netflix  O NFLX  and Amazon com  O AMZN   the year s best S P performers  While consumer discretionary fourth quarter profits are forecast to be up 8 4 percent  that is below the 13 6 percent growth that was forecast only three months ago  according to Thomson Reuters data   Twenty five companies in this sector so far have warned and none gave positive guidance  the highest number of negative forecasts since at least 2006  according to FactSet  In a typical fourth quarter  only two thirds of earnings pre announcements in this group are negative   By comparison  overall 85 S P 500 companies guided below analysts  estimates for the quarter and 26 issued positive guidance  roughly in line with recent quarters  FactSet data showed  Macy s  N M  this week cut its earnings outlook for the second time and blamed a fall in sales on unusually warm weather that kept consumers from buying coats  It also cited the strong dollar   Companies that have warned also include L Brands  N LB   GameStop  N GME   Starbucks  O SBUX    Target   N TGT  and AutoNation  N AN   Specialty retailers have given the most negative guidance  while 17 companies in the sector have cited the strong U S  dollar as a reason behind the lowered outlooks  FactSet said   As earnings forecasts come down  some strategists say the expected boost to consumer spending from lower energy prices may have been overblown  Consumers still have debts to pay down    The thing behind the consumer not spending despite what looks like tailwinds from lower energy price  is   people are still deleveraging from prior to 2008   said Robert Pavlik  chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York   The consumer is still being weighed down   EARNINGS RECESSION  Overall  S P 500 earnings are forecast to have dropped 4 2 percent in the fourth quarter  That would be their second straight quarterly decline  Thomson Reuters data showed  which would meet the common definition of a profit recession   Revenues are expected to be slightly less bad   with only a 3 2 percent decline expected  since profits can be lifted by stock buybacks  cost cuts and other maneuvers   When final reports are tallied  S P 500 companies are expected to show zero profit growth for all of 2015  Profit growth of 7 5 percent is forecast for 2016  but that estimate has also fallen since Oct  1  when it stood at 10 3 percent   The energy sector is expected to be the biggest drag on S P 500 results as oil prices continue an almost relentless decline that began in mid 2014  The materials sector is also expected to show a double digit profit drop  hit by a downward spiral in other commodities  Goldman Sachs  N GS  on Thursday lowered its earnings per share forecast for 2015  2016 and 2017  saying energy was the main reason behind the revisions  It expects the sector to post an annual operating loss for 2015 for the first time since its data began in 1967  Goldman Sachs also cited the slowdown in China and signs that profit margins have peaked  That could be bleak news for the stock market  which posted a slight loss for 2015 and has been battered at the start of 2016 by a China stock selloff and growing concerns over a global economic slowdown  Major indexes lost about 6 percent last week  the worst start to a year since records were kept  Even with the selloff  valuations are stretched  The S P 500 trades at 15 7 times forward earnings  well above its 10 year median of 14 7  according to Thomson Reuters data

342978,NYT,Herbalife Strife  Icahn   Ackman Duke It Out ,opinion,I have seen a lot of things in my two decades in the investment industry  but seeing a verbal cage fight between a senile 76 year old corporate raider and a white haired  46 year old Harvard grad makes for surprisingly entertaining viewing  The investment heavyweights I am referring to are the elder Carl Icahn  Chairman of Icahn Enterprises  and junior Bill Ackman  CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management  If getting a few billionaires yelling at each other on live TV is not enough to interest you  then how about adding some tongue laced f bombs coupled with blow by blow screaming from background traders  What s the source of the venomous  spitting hatred between these stock market tycoons  In short  it can be boiled down to a decade old lawsuit  profitable for both I might add   and a disagreement over the short position of a controversial stock  Herbalife  HLF   Regarding the legal spat  in 2003 the SEC was investigating Ackman while his Gotham Partners hedge fund was collapsing  so Ackman asked Icahn to buy shares of Hallwood Realty in hopes of salvaging his fund  Eventually  Icahn bought shares  but a difference in opinion over the transaction led to a lawsuit that Icahn lost  thereby forcing him to pay Ackman  9 million  Icahn also had a beef with Ackman s handling of Herbalife  Parading in front of hundreds of investors to self indulgently create a bear raid on an unsuspecting company is poor form in Icahn s view  and Carl wanted to make sure Ackman was aware of this investing faux pas  Normally  investing reporting over cable television is rather mundane  unless you consider entertainers like Jim Cramer yelling  booyah  amusing  On the other hand  if you enjoy billionaires embracing the spirit of the Jerry Springer Show by screaming purple faced profanities  then you should check out the CNBC cage fight in its entirety If you lack time in your busy schedule to soak in the full bloody battle  then here is a synopsis of my favorite highlights  Icahn on Ackman the  Crybaby    I really sort of have had it with this guy Ackman  I get a call from this Ackman guy  I m telling you  he s like the crybaby in the schoolyard  I went to a tough school in Queens  They used to beat up the little Jewish boys  He was like a little Jewish boy crying that the world was taking advantage of him   Ackman Referring to Icahn as a  Bully  and Himself as  Roadkill on the Hedge Fund Highway    Why did he  Icahn  threaten to sue me  He was a bully  Okay  I was not in a good place in my business career  I was under investigation by Spitzer  winding down my fund  There was negative press about Gotham Partners  I was short MBIA  MBI   They were aggressively attacking me and Carl Icahn thought this guy  Ackman  is roadkill on the hedge fund highway  This is not an honest guy  Icahn  who keeps his word  This is a guy who takes advantage of little people   Agitated Icahn Tearing a New One for Scott Wapner  CNBC Commentator    I didn t get on to be bullied by you  Wapner   I m going to talk about what I want to talk about  Okay  If you want to take that position  I will never go on CNBC  You can say what the hell you want  I m going to talk about what Ackman just said about me  not about Herbalife  I ll talk about Herbalife when I want to  not when you ask me  I m never going on a show with you again  that s for damn sure  Let s start with what I want to say  Ackman is a liar   Icahn on Another Ackman Rampage   I will tell you something  As far as I m concerned  he wanted to have dinner with me and I laughed  I couldn t figure out if he was the most sanctimonious guy or the most arrogant  the guy takes inordinate risk I don t have an investment with Ackman  I wouldn t have one if you paid me  if Ackman paid me to do it  I made a huge mistake getting involved with him After he won  the lawsuit   he planted some article in the New York Times pounding his chest telling the world how great he was  You know  as far as I m concerned the guy is a major loser   New CNBC Revenue Stream  There hasn t been this much fireworks since Professor  on the Pimco Boss s assessment that the  cult of equity is dying  last July  In retrospect  that minor tiff was child s play relative to the Icahn vs  Ackman battle  With CNBC viewership down from pre crisis levels  the network may strongly consider instituting a new pay per view revenue stream dedicated to battles between opposing investment enemies  I will even offer up my services to verbally smack down some of the enemies I ve written about previously  If my phones don t ring  then I can always offer up my American Investment Idol concept in which I can play Simon Cowell  This may or may not be the last round of the Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman fight  but the ultimate bragging rights may depend on the ultimate outcome of Ackman s Herbalife short  If Icahn makes a tender offer for Herbalife  I will anxiously wait for CNBC s Scott Wapner to invite Carl back on the show  I can hardly wait  Disclosure  Sidoxia Capital Management  SCM  and some of its clients hold positions in certain exchange

421568,EXC,Exelon  EXC  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Exelon  EXC  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 8  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 58 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 5  
Revenues are expected to be  7 22 billion  down 13 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 46  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exelon 
For Exelon  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 10  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Exelon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Exelon would post earnings of  0 88 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 88  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Exelon appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/exelon-exc-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200382692,200382692

As far as the numbers  S P 500 futures were little changed just after the vote came in 
Also on the political landscape  healthcare stocks will be active after a federal appeals court ruled unconstitutional the individual mandate that citizens must have health insurance  which is part of the Affordable Care Act  also known as Obamacare  
The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the mandate was in the taxing power of Congress  but a Texas court ruled that was no longer applicable given that the penalty for not having insurance was later lowered to zero dollars

Adjusted operating expenses edged down slightly year over year to  5 9 billion in the fourth quarter  Expenses included provisions for litigation  regulatory and similar matters of  151 million 
Business Division Performance
The Global wealth management division s adjusted operating profit before tax came in at  769 million  down 22  year over year  Lower transaction based revenues due to fall in client activity were partially offset by higher net interest margins and income along with loan growth  Net new money outflows were  7 9 billion in the fourth quarter 
The Asset Management unit s adjusted operating profit rose 15  year over year to  134 million in the quarter under review  supported by higher performance fees along with reduced personnel costs 
Personal   Corporate banking division s adjusted operating profit before tax was down 13  year over year to  375 million  Lower transaction based income  together with higher credit loss expenses  resulted in the decline  Notably  annualized net new business volume growth for personal banking was 2 2

Strong Capital Position
As of Dec 31  2018  UBS Group s invested assets were  3 10 trillion  down 4 9  year over year  Total assets came in at  958 5 billion  climbing around 2  
UBS Group s phase in common equity tier  CET  1 ratio was 13 1  as of Dec 31  2018  compared with 13 8  as of Dec 31  2017  Furthermore  phase in CET 1 capital increased 2 9  year over year to  34 5 billion  as of Dec 31  2018  Fully applied risk weighted assets climbed 8 3  to  263 7 billion  
Outlook
As geopolitical tensions  rising protectionism and trade disputes persist  management expects these factors to affect investor sentiment and confidence and thus  client activity in first quarter 2019

281481,AAPL,Market Ignoring Strong Earnings,opinion,"What a frustrating week  Earnings season is living up to lofty expectations with some very impressive numbers  as approximately 80  of S P companies have beaten expectations  But the market just doesn t seem to care  A strong Friday session could have given the major indices a positive weekly performance  Instead  two of the major indices could muster only anemic gains  while the third couldn t even do that  And these results come in the wake of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  doubling profits year over year  along with better than expected results for GDP and consumer sentiment  At the end of the day  the S P rose only 0 11  to 2669 9 for a slightly negative week  The NASDAQ inched forward by 0 02  to 7119 8 and the Dow declined 0 05  to 24 311 2  marking weekly losses of 0 4  and 0 6   respectively  The editors are as annoyed as anyone by this market right now  but they are overall pretty positive that stocks will pick an upward direction soon  We saw this optimism in the portfolios today  Home Run Investor added an energy name while TAZR bought a bullish ETF as a bet on rising tech stocks  Tracey added two names to Insider Trader and Value Investor each  while also pulling a double digit profit from the latter  Learn all about these moves in the highlights section below 

Today s Portfolio Highlights  Home Run Investor  Brian Bolan is getting more and more bullish on this market  and today he wanted to widen the portfolio s diversification even further by adding an energy name  The editor picked up Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure  SOI   a manufacturer and provider of patented mobile proppant management systems to oil and natural gas well sites  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company has an Earnings ESP of approximately 6  for the quarter being reported on May 8  The portfolio is now two holdings shy of being fully invested at 20 names  Get more specifics on this new addition in the full write up Insider Trader  Shares of Philip Morris  PM  are down 20  year to date and it just reported disappointing earnings  But that didn t stop the Deputy General Counsel from buying 3 000 shares a few days ago  Tracey was shocked to see the lawyer buy  since they are usually more conservative than other insiders and rarely make moves outside of a cluster buy scenario  She decided to take a chance and add the name to her holdings  

But that wasn t all  The editor really loves the small cap E Ps right now  so she decided to buy Lonestar Resources  LONE  on Friday even though the portfolio already has a lot of exposure to energy  Earlier this month  the CEO and COO picked up shares  Tracey added each stock with 10  allocations  Learn a lot more about these new additions in the complete commentary TAZR Trader  The portfolio has a lot of cash on the sidelines and Kevin wants to make a bet that the tech sector s recent lows will hold and move higher after Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  reports on Tuesday  Therefore  the editor added a  starter  position of 5  in the NASDAQ 100 3X Bull ETF  TQQQ   Read more about this move and Kevin s overall trading philosophy in the full write up Value Investor  The portfolio made two new buys on Friday  Tracey is a big fan of the banks right now and she wants to get a piece of the economic boom in California  Therefore  she bought PacWest Bancorp  PACW   a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  regional bank that is expected to grow earnings 26  this year and another 8 2  next year  But shares are still cheap 
	The other buy was Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC   which sold off recently despite a strong quarterly report  The portfolio is already overweighted in the semiconductors and storage sector  but the stock is so dirt cheap after the overdone pullback that Tracey decided to add it  The portfolio also sold KKR  KKR  today for a more than 10  return after momentarily falling to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Read the complete commentary for more on all of today s moves  Counterstrike   The reason for the selling has to do with the idea that we might be running into  Peak Earnings   A term you will start to hear more   The idea behind this phrase is that earnings just won t get any better than they are now  Since the market is forward looking  all the moves higher in earnings are being sold into  thus hurting the overall indices   The end result is a market that is very choppy and very volatile  I thought this week would be the week the market picked a direction  but we are sitting in the same area we were last week  so perhaps next week we will make a move   We will see if this momentum will continue into May  Remember the old saying  Sell in May and go away   Let s hope that isn t the case this year      Jeremy Mullin Have a Great Weekend  Jim Giaquinto

375418,AMZN,FedEx Rises as Courier Sees E Commerce Gain in  Transition Year ,news," Bloomberg     FedEx  NYSE FDX  climbed as the courier predicted a  transition year   for fiscal 2020  with an improving outlook for e commerce profits tempered by concerns over international trade tensions 
Revenue per package in the ground delivery operation rose 2 2  in the quarter ending May 31 as volume growth accelerated to 8 8   FedEx said in a statement late Tuesday  That signaled progress in the courier s push to extract higher profits from the surge in home deliveries driven by online shopping 
FedEx is stepping up efforts to become the low cost provider of e commerce deliveries  paring jobs and partnering with companies such as  Dollar General Corp   NYSE DG   to add pickup and drop off sites  But FedEx is struggling to shore up its Express air delivery division    the unit most threatened by escalating trade tensions  especially between the U S  and China 
 The utilization of the ground network and the opportunity they feel that they have with e commerce to significantly grow is the positive that people are taking out of this   said Trip Miller  managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners  which owns FedEx shares   But certainly  we didn t hear anything positive about China  We didn t hear anything positive about Europe  
The shares advanced 2 1  to  159 25 before the start of regular trading Wednesday in New York  The shares had dropped 3 3  this year through Tuesday  while rival  United Parcel  Service Inc  NYSE UPS   was little changed and a Standard   Poor s index of industrial companies advanced 19  
Weak Forecast
FedEx has been struggling to keep up with Wall Street s expectations as the company pours money into making deliveries more efficient and struggles with a cloudy trade outlook 
Adjusted earnings for the current fiscal year will drop by  a mid single digit percentage  from  15 52 a share in the year just ended  FedEx said in the statement  Analysts were expecting  16 15 in fiscal 2020    an estimate that had already been whittled down from  20 about six months ago 
 Our fiscal 2020 performance is being negatively affected by continued weakness in global trade and industrial production  especially at FedEx Express   said Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf 
That impact extended a longstanding sense of frustration at FedEx with President Donald Trump s willingness to stoke trade tensions  said Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith 
 Clearly  we ve been very disappointed over the last few years with the assumptions that we made on the growth in international trade  particularly with the Trump administration   Smith said on a conference call with analysts and investors   We have become a protectionist country  
New Weapon
FedEx fired a new weapon in the simmering U S  China trade war this week  suing the Trump administration to block enforcement of trade restrictions that have placed the company in Beijing s crosshairs The federal lawsuit came after the White House barred U S  companies from selling technology to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co 
While trying to comply  FedEx employees mistakenly flagged packages involving Huawei  Now China is considering adding the courier to a list of so called unreliable entities 
E Commerce Challenge
Closer to home  the next 12 months will be pivotal for FedEx as it seeks to stem the decline in profit margins at the company s ground unit  Recent moves include extending deliveries to seven days a week and reducing reliance on the U S  Postal Service 
FedEx s Express business cut ties with Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   as the largest online retailer muscles into the delivery business  FedEx said it would focus on more profitable customers 
The challenge for FedEx    and UPS    is that deliveries to homes  where drivers often handle a single package at each stop  tend to be less profitable than business deliveries  where they might pick up or drop off several parcels 
 Fiscal year 2020 is in many ways a transition year for FedEx as we continue to reinvigorate our business to capitalize on e commerce growth and execute significant initiatives to reduce our cost to serve in the U S    said Chief Operating Officer Rajesh Subramaniam 
Those efforts are softening the blow from the weak profit forecast for fiscal 2020    but the pressure will remain on FedEx to show sustained gains from the rise of online shopping 
 FedEx is not out of the woods   Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a note to investors   but base expectations are lower and if there is any shift towards a more optimistic macro environment  we expect shares to move higher from current levels  ",2019-06-26,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fedex-rises-as-courier-sees-ecommerce-gain-in-transition-year-1907980,1907980

313080,GE,Exclusive  Russia s drive to replace Western power technology hits snag,news,"By Anastasia Lyrchikova MOSCOW  Reuters    Russia s drive to build a large power generating turbine to lessen its dependence on Western technology has suffered a major set back after a prototype broke beyond repair  two sources familiar with the project told Reuters  In the past few years Russia has imported the large capacity gas turbines required to run modern power stations from firms such as  Siemens   DE SIEGn   GE  N GE  and  Alstom   PA ALSO   After Western sanctions were imposed on Russia over the conflict with Ukraine four years ago  Russian President Vladimir Putin urged officials to replace imported technology with home grown substitutes in energy  software  aerospace and medicine  The mishap with the 110 Megawatt turbine  a capacity large enough to power a sizeable town  underlines the technical challenges  Testing was underway on a prototype 110 MW turbine at the Saturn engineering plant in Rybinsk  central Russia  in December last year according to one of the two sources  who are both in the energy sector and familiar with the results of the tests   The turbine fell apart   said the first source  who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject   They tried to repair it in time for March  but they did not manage it   March was the target date for completion of tests on the turbine  Putin  in power since 1999  won a second consecutive term in an election on March 18  The first source  and a second source  both said it was not possible to rebuild the prototype turbine and the project would have to start again with new equipment   The turbine broke up   said the second source  who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media   There s no turbine  that s it    NOT FATAL  Without any home grown equivalents  Russia should in most cases still be able to buy turbines from Western suppliers  but U S  and European Union sanctions have made it harder to import Western power technology under certain circumstances  Last year Russia clandestinely delivered turbines made by Siemens to a power station in Crimea  which is subject to sanctions  and the European Union retaliated by imposing extra sanctions on officials and companies involved in the operation  Set backs to the domestic turbine program could hamper the modernization of power generation if growing tensions with Western states result in tighter sanctions since Russia s modernization plan is focused on using gas turbines  The technical hitch also carries a potential political cost  Putin has publicly trumpeted progress in replacing Western technology imports  so any failures will jar with the picture of success he has painted  The new turbine is being developed by a consortium of ODK  a unit of state owned conglomerate Rostec that owns the Saturn factory where the testing was being conducted  Russian state technology firm RUSNANO  and state energy firm InterRAO  In a statement  ODK said one of the mechanisms of the prototype turbine had malfunctioned  It said that would delay work on the project  but could be fixed   It is not fatal for the project   It said set backs were to be expected since this was a pioneering project for Russia  RUSNANO acknowledged there had been an accident but gave no details  It said it remained committed to the turbine project and expects it will be completed  InterRAO declined to comment  Russia s Trade and Industry Ministry  which oversees the machine building sector  declined to comment and referred questions to Rostec  WESTERN SANCTIONS Large capacity gas turbines have been in use around the world for years but their construction is tricky to perfect  Because they operate at extremely high speeds and high temperatures  they need to be engineered to very precise standards and they use sophisticated electronic control systems to make sure that they operate efficiently  For many years Russia made no major investment in developing the technology because it was able to import the turbines or the know how to produce them  A scheme started in the 1990s to develop a large capacity turbine produced prototypes but they did not go into production  At a meeting in Russia s second city of Saint Petersburg in May last year  chaired by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev  Energy Minister Alexander Novak said a 110 MW turbine had been developed and testing should be completed by March 2018  
 This is the first Russian produced powerful machine with 100 percent domestic manufacture and it will  of course  help us to completely substitute purchases of foreign equipment of this capacity   Novak told the meeting  His ministry did not respond to questions on Tuesday about the set back ",2018-04-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive-russias-drive-to-replace-western-power-technology-hits-snag-1398872,1398872

410611,NEM,Gold Miners  Q2 18 Fundamentals For August 19  2018,opinion,"The major gold miners  stocks plummeted in brutal cascading selling this week as stops were run  That shattered strong multi year support  devastating sentiment among the handful of contrarians remaining in this forsaken sector  With fear and despair extreme  it s critical to take a deep breath and get grounded in the gold miners  just reported Q2 18 fundamentals  They reveal if this surprise anomalous plunge was justified 
Four times a year publicly traded companies release treasure troves of valuable information in the form of quarterly reports  Companies trading in the States are required to file 10 Qs with the US Securities and Exchange Commission by 45 calendar days after quarter ends  Canadian companies have similar requirements  In other countries with half year reporting  many companies still partially report quarterly 
The definitive list of major gold mining stocks to analyze comes from the world s most popular gold stock investment vehicle  the GDX VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX   Its composition and performance are similar to the benchmark HUI gold stock index  GDX utterly dominates this sector  with no meaningful competition  This week GDX s net assets are 33 4x larger than the next biggest 1x long major gold miners ETF 
GDX is effectively the gold mining industry s blue chip index  including the biggest and best publicly traded gold miners from around the globe  GDX inclusion is not only prestigious  but grants gold miners better access to the vast pools of stock market capital  As ETF investing continues to rise  capital inflows into leading sector ETFs require their managers to buy more shares in underlying component companies 
GDX s component list this week ran 49  Gold Miners  long  While the great majority of GDX stocks do fit that bill  it also contains gold royalty companies and major silver miners  All the world s big primary gold miners publicly traded in major markets are included  Every quarter I look into the latest operating and financial results of the top 34 GDX companies  which is just an arbitrary number fitting neatly into these tables 
That s a commanding sample  as GDX s 34 largest components now account for a whopping 91 7  of its total weighting  These elite miners that reported Q2 18 results produced 241 0 metric tons of gold  which accounts for fully 28 8  of last quarter s total global gold production  That ran 835 5t per the recently released Q2 18 Gold Demand Trends report from the World Gold Council  I ll discuss production more below 
Most of these top 34 GDX gold miners trade in the US and Canada where comprehensive quarterly reporting is required by regulators  But some trade in Australia and the UK  where companies just need to report in half year increments  Fortunately those gold miners do still tend to issue production reports without financial statements each quarter  There are still wide variations in reporting styles and data offered 
Every quarter I wade through a ton of data from these elite gold miners  latest results and dump it into a big spreadsheet for analysis  The highlights make it into these tables  Blank fields mean a company had not reported that data for Q2 18 as of this Wednesday  Looking at the major gold miners  latest results in aggregate offers valuable insights on this industry s current fundamental health unrivaled anywhere else 
The first couple columns of these tables show each GDX component s symbol and weighting within this ETF as of this week  While most of these stocks trade on US exchanges  some symbols are listings from companies  primary foreign stock exchanges  That s followed by each gold miner s Q2 18 production in ounces  which is mostly in pure gold terms  That excludes byproduct metals often present in gold ore 
Those are usually silver and base metals like copper  which are valuable  They are sold to offset some of the considerable costs of gold mining  lowering per ounce costs and thus raising overall profitability  In cases where companies didn t separate out gold and lumped all production into gold equivalent ounces  those GEOs are included instead  Then production s absolute year over year change from Q2 17 is shown 
Next comes gold miners  most important fundamental data for investors  cash costs and all in sustaining costs per ounce mined  The latter directly drives profitability which ultimately determines stock prices  These key costs are also followed by YoY changes  Last but not least the annual changes are shown in operating cash flows generated  hard GAAP earnings  sales  and cash on hand with a couple exceptions 
Percentage changes aren t relevant or meaningful if data shifted from positive to negative or vice versa  or if derived from two negative numbers  So in those cases I included raw underlying data rather than weird or misleading percentage changes  This whole dataset together offers a fantastic high level read on how the major gold miners are faring fundamentally as an industry  Was this week s plummeting righteous 


This ongoing quarterly post earnings season project to better understand how the gold mining industry is actually faring fundamentally is tedious and time consuming  The best insights don t emerge until all the research is complete  as the big picture is more illuminating than individual companies  results  As I was doing much of this work this week  the plummeting gold stock prices cast a dark psychological pall over everything 
I always start at the top of GDX s component list and gradually work my way down  examining the latest quarterly filings from each company  Early on I was shocked by the sharp annual production declines at the world s biggest gold miners  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  and Barrick Gold have run neck and neck as the top gold miners for long decades now  Compared to most other gold miners  their resources may as well be unlimited 
They have diversified portfolios of gold mines across continents and many countries  and deep pipelines of exploration projects and new mine builds  NEM and ABX pour vast amounts of capital into maintaining their gold production as existing mines are depleted  The major gold miners hate reporting declines in production  as investors punish stocks for it with sizable selling  It is seen as signaling deteriorating health 
So gold miners suffering production drops often intentionally obscure it by omitting normal year over year comparisons from their press releases announcing quarterly results  They don t present the tables with the current quarter next to the comparable prior year quarter like they do when production is growing  It feels like a game of misdirection  emphasizing other metrics while forcing investors to dig deeper for that data 
The bigger the gold miners  the more opportunities they have to make up production shortfalls at some of their mines from other mines in their portfolios  So it was stunning to see NEM report its Q2 18 production plunging 14 1  YoY  And ABX s was much worse  plummeting a catastrophic 25 5  YoY  That ominous trend infected other top gold miners too  Goldcorp mined 10 1  less gold in Q2 18 than it did a year earlier 
Kinross Gold s production fell 13 4  YoY  Together these 4 elite major gold miners account for almost a quarter of GDX s total weighting  How on earth can their total production plunge 17 3  from 4 1m ounces in Q2 17 to 3 4m ounces in Q2 18  That was actually contrary to the gold mining industry as a whole  Again according to that latest WGC GDT  overall world mine production grew 3 0  YoY from Q2 17 to Q2 18 
The excuses given are nothing new to gold mining investors  primarily lower grade ore processed along with geological and geopolitical challenges at various individual mines  Wresting gold from the bowels of the earth in remote locations is never easy  as all the low hanging fruit has long since been mined  With even the biggest and the best gold miners failing to maintain production  peak gold theories are bolstered 
Incredibly as a whole  these top 34 GDX gold miners responsible for well over a quarter of the total world gold mined in Q2 saw their overall production plummet 20 9  YoY to 7 7m ounces  That s skewed though  as two major South African gold miners had reported their Q2 17 production a year ago this week but had yet to disclose Q2 18 production as of Wednesday s data cutoff for this essay  They chose not to do it this year 
AngloGold Ashanti and Gold Fields report in half year increments  so they have no obligation to separate out quarters  I wonder if the reason they did last year but not this year is to mask slowing production  If their H1 18 results are divided by two  they would ve added another 789k and 497k ounces  But that still leaves GDX s top 34 miners with collective gold production down a sharp 7 7  YoY  way worse than the industry 
While Q2 18 s underperformance by the biggest gold miners dominating GDX and the HUI was striking  it is nothing new  That s why I ve long recommended investors avoid many of the largest gold miners  Mid tier miners with growing production as they bring new mines online and much smaller market caps have far greater upside potential during gold uplegs  They are bucking the increasingly evident peak gold predicament 
Gold deposits economically viable to mine are very rare in the natural world  and getting much harder to find after centuries of exploration  It is growing ever more expensive to explore for gold  in places that are getting less hospitable with every passing year  Even after new deposits are discovered  jumping through all the Draconian regulatory hoops necessary to secure permitting for construction can take another decade 
Building the gold mines takes additional years and hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars each  This industry normally has enough capital to invest in replenishing depleting production  But ever since 2013 when gold plunged on extreme central bank machinations  the gold miners have been heavily starved of necessary capital  So their new production pipeline has inexorably withered away to a shadow of its former self 
As long as gold stocks remain deeply out of favor among investors because gold prices are so low  this supply deterioration will continue if not accelerate  But even if gold doubled or tripled today and stayed high for years  it would still take well over a decade for world mined supply to adjust  Some top mining CEOs and analysts believe we are seeing peak gold  that production will keep declining regardless of gold prices 
Peak gold is likely bearish for the largest gold miners that drive GDX and the HUI  Capital inflows from investors will wane along with their production  But lower gold mined supply on balance going forward is wildly bullish for the mid tier and junior gold miners growing their production  The resulting higher gold prices will catapult their profits and thus stock prices higher  attracting in investors fleeing the struggling majors 
The only way to reap these massive gains is directly investing in the best individual gold miners  Their fundamentals are far superior to their sector as a whole  While buying GDX is easy  the lion s share of that capital is funneled into the major gold miners with slowing production  Their underperformance will dilute away any outperformance among mid tier miners in this ETF  leading to mediocre overall gains 
One key reason slowing production is bad for gold miners is it usually leads to proportionally higher costs  Again in Q2 18 NEM s production fell 14 1  YoY  so its all in sustaining costs rose a symmetrical 15 8  YoY  ABX s colossal 25 5  production drop fueled 20 6  higher AISCs  And KGC s 13 4  lower gold production last quarter forced its AISCs 11 9  higher  Higher mining costs naturally drive profits lower 
With major gold miners  production falling sharply  their costs of mining should be proportionally higher  Gold mining costs are largely fixed during mine planning stages  when engineers and geologists decide which ore to mine  how to dig to it  and how to process it  The actual mining generally requires the same levels of infrastructure  equipment  and employees quarter after quarter  Little changes in throughput terms 
The mills processing the gold bearing ore and inevitable accompanying waste rock have hard limits to tonnages they can chew through  When richer ore is processed  more ounces of gold are produced to spread the big fixed costs across  But when mine managers have to dig through lower grade ore  either on the way to higher grade stuff later or in depleting mines  fewer ounces of gold must bear the full cost burden 
So as I started digging through the top 34 GDX components  Q2 results  I expected to see the major gold miners  collective AISCs rise due to lower production  That s certainly bearish fundamentally  portending lower profits that could justify some of the brutal gold stock selling this summer  But as a whole  rather amazingly these elite gold miners held the line on costs  The top majors  rises were offset by other miners 
There are two major ways to measure gold mining costs  classic cash costs per ounce and the superior all in sustaining costs per ounce  Both are useful metrics  Cash costs are the acid test of gold miner survivability in lower gold price environments  revealing the worst case gold levels necessary to keep the mines running  All in sustaining costs show where gold needs to trade to maintain current mining tempos indefinitely 
Cash costs naturally encompass all cash expenses necessary to produce each ounce of gold  including all direct production costs  mine level administration  smelting  refining  transport  regulatory  royalty  and tax expenses  In Q2 18  these top 34 GDX component gold miners that reported cash costs averaged  610 per ounce  That was merely up 0 8  YoY from Q2 17  rather remarkable considering the lower production 
The capitulation grade gold stock selling this week was horrendous  with GDX plummeting 9 5  in just 3 trading days ending Wednesday  This leading gold stock ETF plunged to  18 60 per share  shattering its major  21 support that had held strong through five major challenges since the dawn of 2017  Down a dreadful 20 0  year to date  GDX was trading at a miserable 2 5 year low on cascading stop loss selling 
But with cash costs averaging  610 per ounce  the major gold miners are certainly in no fundamental peril  While gold somehow managed to plunge 2 9  in those same few trading days despite crazy all time record spec gold futures shorts  it was still near  1176  The gold stocks face no existential threat as long as gold prices remain far above the cash costs of mining it  There s nothing to fear fundamentally this week 
Way more important than cash costs are the far superior all in sustaining costs  They were introduced by the World Gold Council in June 2013 to give investors a much better understanding of what it really costs to maintain gold mines as ongoing concerns  AISCs include all direct cash costs  but then add on everything else that is necessary to maintain and replenish operations at current gold production levels 
These additional expenses include exploration for new gold to mine to replace depleting deposits  mine development and construction expenses  remediation  and mine reclamation  They also include the corporate level administration expenses necessary to oversee gold mines  All in sustaining costs are the most important gold mining cost metric by far for investors  revealing gold miners  true operating profitability 
With the top 34 GDX gold miners  Q2 18 production down 20 9  YoY or even 7 7  if that implied South African production is added in  I would ve bet their AISCs would ve surged proportionally  Yet incredibly they actually slipped 1 3  YoY to just  856 per ounce  This was no anomaly either  as the top 34 GDX miners  AISCs have averaged  867   868   858  and  884 over the past four quarters  Q2 18 s were in trend 
The fundamental implications of this are very bullish  proving that this week s gold stock capitulation was purely an overdone herd sentiment thing  Gold averaged  1306 in Q2 18  up 3 9  YoY  That means the elite major gold miners were earning average profits just under  450 per ounce  Thanks to the slightly lower AISCs and modestly higher gold price  those earnings rose 15 2  YoY from the  390 per ounce in Q2 17 
With gold mining a heck of a lot more profitable last quarter than a year earlier  you d think the gold stock prices would ve been proportionally higher  Yet GDX s average price last quarter was 1 5  lower YoY  That makes zero sense fundamentally  And even if this week s capitulation grade  1175 gold was able to magically persist as if those crazy record gold futures shorts were never covered  gold mining is still very profitable 
At Q2 18 s average AISCs which are again exactly in line with recent years  levels   1175 gold would still yield hefty  319 per ounce profits for the major gold miners  That number is quite provocative  This Wednesday the flagship HUI gold stock index plunged to 143 3 on that cascading stop loss selling  a deep 2 5 year low  But the first time the HUI ever hit this week s levels was way back in May 2002  16 2 years ago 
Then gold was trading near  326  which was its best levels of its young secular bull at that point  Think about this absurd fundamental disconnect  Today s gold stock prices were first seen way back when the entire gold price was about the same level as today s absolute profitability alone  That is just ridiculous  highlighting the extreme undervaluation in gold stocks  Their crazy low stock prices are an extreme anomaly 
Should a sector running hefty 27  profit margins even at  1175 gold be trading this week at price levels first seen when gold was 72  lower  Hell no  Similar past capitulation like anomalies have led to huge subsequent mean reversion rebound gains  During 2008 s stock panic  the HUI fell as low as 151 6 in response to  720 gold  Those were higher gold stock prices than this week despite gold being 38  lower 
Just like this week  back in October 2008 fear was extreme as investors fled gold stocks  They foolishly assumed extreme gold and gold stock declines could persist indefinitely rather than quickly burning themselves out  So the traders who couldn t get past their own herd driven emotions sold at the bottom  They unfortunately missed the HUI more than quadrupling over the next 2 9 years with a major 319 0  bull run 
As long as the gold miners can produce gold at all in sustaining costs way below prevailing gold prices  they will generate big profits for investors  Eventually their stock price levels have to reflect their true underlying profitability  With  1175ish gold and  856 AISCs  the gold miners  stock prices must rebound radically higher  Their extreme low levels today are fundamentally absurd  they can t and won t last for long 
The rest of the top 34 GDX gold miners  core fundamentals in Q2 18 reflected their lower year over year production  Their overall cash flows generated from operations fell 18 3  YoY to  2747m  That s not out of line considering the 7 2  decrease in sales to  9993m due to less gold mined  Interestingly in addition to mining 20 9  less gold YoY excluding those non reporting South African miners  silver production fell more 
GDX has plenty of major silver miners among its ranks  as the pool of major gold miners is fairly small  Silver is much less profitable to mine than gold at current depressed price levels  so traditional big silver miners are increasingly investing in diversifying into gold mining  The top 34 GDX components  overall silver production plummeted 32 4  YoY to 29 1m ounces in Q2 18  That helped sales fall despite higher gold prices 
These top 34 GDX gold miners  total GAAP accounting profits reported to regulators looked like a disaster in Q2 18  They cratered 66 2  YoY to  802m  But that s very misleading  as one off charges and gains flowing through to miners  bottom lines can greatly distort headline profitability  There were a couple massive non recurring gains in Q2 17 results that I discussed a year ago that artificially boosted those profits 
Back then Barrick Gold reported an enormous  880m gain selling half and quarter interests in a couple major gold projects in Argentina and Chile  And IAMGOLD reversed impairment charges to report a huge  524m non cash gain  Removing just these two unusual items alone from overall Q2 17 profits recasts Q2 18 s decline as a far milder 17 1  YoY  That s about what you d expect with sales sliding 7 2  in that span 
While not included in this table  the average trailing twelve month price to earnings ratios of these major gold miners declined 2 2  YoY to 38 0x  And that number is skewed way high by a few outliers  as there are plenty of top 34 GDX gold miners trading at cheap TTM P Es in the low double digits or even single digits this week  The gold miners  earnings are fine  and don t remotely justify this week s capitulation like plunge 
Another fundamental metric for gold miners  health is their cash balances  Despite the lower production and sales in Q2 18  these top 34 GDX components exited it with  12 4b of cash on their balance sheets  That provides a huge buffer to weather lower gold  and gives them enough capital firepower to expand existing mines and build or buy new ones to help offset declining production  That was only down 9 6  YoY 
If your view on gold mining stocks is solely based on their price levels  you re probably convinced they are doomed after this week s plunge  Everyone freaked out as they got sucked into anomalous gold selling which triggered all kinds of involuntary stop loss selling  This definitely wasn t the first time this sector was hammered by fearful herd psychology  and certainly won t be the last  But such extreme anomalies soon reverse 
While sentiment is devastated  the major gold miners  underlying fundamentals remain strong  They are struggling with shrinking production overall  but their mining costs still remain far below prevailing gold prices still driving strong profitability  While sales reflect fewer ounces mined  they are still generating big operating cash flows and earnings  Today s gold stock price levels are ludicrous relative to their fundamentals 
So a big mean reversion rebound higher is inevitable and imminent  While traders can play that in GDX  that is mostly a bet on the largest gold miners with slowing production  The best gains by far will be won in smaller mid tier and junior gold miners with superior fundamentals  A carefully handpicked portfolio of elite gold and silver miners will generate much greater wealth creation than ETFs dominated by underperformers 
At Zeal we ve literally spent tens of thousands of hours researching individual gold stocks and markets  so we can better decide what to trade and when  As of the end of Q2  this has resulted in 1012 stock trades recommended in real time to our newsletter subscribers since 2001  Fighting the crowd to buy low and sell high is very profitable  as all these trades averaged stellar annualized realized gains of  19 3

is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  5 Best Performing IPOs of 2017Wall Street had a ball in 2017 with a strong and steady run for most of the year  Several milestones were achieved by the benchmarks and investors luxuriated in the surge  In fact  the S P 500 gained not only more than 20  but also saw its best year since 2013 The year also marked a bounce back for the U S  IPO market courtesy of improving economic fundamentals and consumer sentiment  Successful IPOs poured in primarily from the biotech and technology sectors while the comeback of the Chinese issuers added to the bliss Going by  from Renaissance Capital  160 IPOs were priced this year  marking a whopping 52 4  increase from the last  Total proceeds raised in the year swelled 88 8  from the prior year to  35 5 billion However  considering the broader market s stellar returns  the performance of the IPO market was less robust than expected  primarily due to the underwhelming performance of Snap and Blue Apron  Investors became concerned about valuation and adopted a restrained approach in investing in IPOs  Moreover  the reservations associated with the tax overhaul acted as a dampener Nevertheless  the outlook appears bright for next year amid expectations of an improved economy  In fact  in its December FOMC meeting  the Fed provided a better outlook  in terms of GDP growth for 2018  A positive revision in projected inflation and expectations of a  strong  job market were also part of the forecasts  In addition  higher corporate earnings and the recent tax overhaul with lower corporate taxes are likely to boost earnings higher  benefiting the stock market and driving the IPO momentum forward Moreover  foreign companies have a huge preference for the U S  market when it comes to listing and this trend is expected to continue next year  Also  IPOs are likely to witness an uptick from  unicorns   or small  and mid sized firms that are valued at more than  1 billion  In fact  per a Reuters   2018 is likely to see the debut of unicorns like Airbnb and Spotify Here is a list of five top performing IPOs in 2017 based on their returns

positive earnings surprise of 1 6  in third quarter 2018  Adjusted earnings per share of 64 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  However  including certain one time items  the bottom line came in at 61 cents  down 55  year over year Increase in revenues  aided by rising loans and deposits were positive factors  Moreover  a strong capital position has been depicted  However  escalating expenses and provisions were undermining factors Certain non recurring items included in the third quarter results were the impact of a  14 million related to valuation of Visa  NYSE V  total return swap  post tax  and  6 million of GreenSky equity securities losses Net income available to common shareholders slumped 58  year over year to  418 million Revenues Improve Y Y  Costs Flare Up  Loans   Deposits RiseTotal adjusted revenues for the quarter came in at  1 63 billion  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  the revenue figure was up 5 2  year over year  driven by higher net interest  as well as non interest income Fifth Third s net interest income  tax equivalent  came in at  1 05 billion  rising 7  year over year  This rise primarily reflects interest earning assets growth and improved short term market rates  partly offset by elevated funding costs Net interest margin expanded 16 basis points  bps  year over year to 3 23   mainly due to improved short term market rates Non interest income plummeted 64  year over year to  7563 million  including certain non recurring items   Excluding significant items  non interest income climbed 3   year over year  to  586 million  Mortgage banking revenues dipped 22  year over year Non interest expenses flared up 3  from the prior year quarter to  1 billion  The upsurge chiefly stemmed from higher salaries  employee benefits  equipment expense  technology costs and other non interest expense As of Sep 30  2018  average loan and lease balances inched up 1  year over year to  93 2 billion  The upswing mainly resulted from increased commercial and consumer loans and leases  Average total deposits advanced 3  year over year to  104 7 billion Credit Quality  A Mixed BagProvision for loan and lease losses surged 28 4  year over year to  86 million  Net charge offs for the reported quarter came in at  72 million or 30 bps of average loans and leases on an annualized basis compared with

320976,BKR,5 Energy Stocks To Buy As U S  Rig Count Hits 10 Month High,opinion,"In its weekly release  Houston based oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   reported a rise in the U S  rig count  number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the country    the eighteenth increase in 21 weeks  This can be attributed to addition in the tally of oil directed rigs as commodity prices tick up and efficiencies improve 
Importantly  bulk of the gains  11 out of 20  were in the Permian Basin of West Texas  an area that continues to be profitable even at the current low oil prices 
Analysis of the Data
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in exploration and production in the U S  totaled 588 for the week ended Nov 18  2016  This was up by 20 from the previous week s rig count and resumes the trend of recent increases that has only been snapped thrice since June  Rig counts have generally been rising during the last six months since plunging to an all time low of 404 in May  with the addition of a flood of new units 
Despite the steady climb  the current nationwide rig count is considerably lower than the prior year level of 757  It rose to a 22 year high in 2008  peaking at 2 031 in the weeks ending Aug 29 and Sep 12 
For the week under review  units engaged in land operations   which rose by 17 to 563   were the primary reason for the gain in rig count  Meanwhile  inland waters activity was up by 1 to 2 rigs  while offshore drilling units increased by 2 to 23 
Oil Rig Count  The oil rig count   that bottomed at 316 in May 2016   improved further  by 19  to 471  In fact  the number of active domestic oil rigs have gone up in twenty two of the last 24 weeks  As a result of this sustained gain  the current tally is now the highest in 10 months  Nevertheless  they are well below the previous year s rig count of 564 and only about 35  of the peak of 1 609 in Oct 2014 
Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count   which plunged to their lowest level on record in Aug   increased for the ninth time in 12 weeks to 116  a gain of 1 rig from the previous week   Still  as per the most recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs are languishing 93  below the all time high of 1 606 reached in late summer 2008  In the year ago period  there were 193 active natural gas rigs 
Miscellaneous Rig Count  The miscellaneous rig count  primarily drilling for geothermal energy  at 1 remained unchanged from the previous week 
Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs increased by 7 to 66  while the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  was up by 13 to 522  In particular  horizontal rig units jumped by 13 from last week s level to 470   the highest since Jan 
Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count was up by 2 to 23   all searching for oil 
Conclusion  Now s the Time to Buy  The Baker Hughes data  issued since 1944 at the end of every week  acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry 
This generates considerable excitement among energy investors and has long been deployed to help predict future oil and gas production  When number of rigs decline  fewer wells are drilled  This means less new oil and gas are discovered  and ultimately production slows down 
As a result  an increase or decrease in the Baker Hughes rotary rig count heavily weighs on the demand for energy services   drilling  completion  production  etc 
With the U S  rig count continuing its upward movement  it might be a good time to add a few energy related stocks to your portfolio

companies expand their drilling operations further  which is not beginning to make a heck of a lot of sense  At the pricing levels of today  drilling for nat gas is nowhere near as profitable as

296300,TSLA, System safeguards  lacking in Tesla crash on autopilot  NTSB,news,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON  Reuters    The chairman of the U S  National Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  said on Tuesday  operational limitations  in the Tesla Model S played a  major role  in a May 2016 crash that killed a driver using the vehicle s semi autonomous  Autopilot  system  The limits on the system include factors such as Tesla being unable to ensure driver attention even when the car is traveling at high speeds  ensuring Autopilot is used only on certain roads and monitoring driver engagement  NTSB said  The NTSB recommended auto safety regulators and automakers take steps to ensure that semi autonomous systems are not misused    System safeguards were lacking   NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said   Tesla allowed the driver to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention   Tesla Inc  O TSLA  said in a statement that  Autopilot significantly increases safety   citing an earlier government study that suggested the system reduced the incidence of crashes  The automaker said it would evaluate the NTSB s recommendations    We will also continue to be extremely clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot is not a fully self driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times   Tesla said  Joshua Brown  a 40 year old Ohio man  was killed near Williston  Florida  when his Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the  Autopilot  mode   SYSTEM LIMITS The incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention  but which cannot completely replace human drivers   The NTSB recommendations will put new pressure on regulators and automakers to deal with the limitations of driver assistance technologies  In its findings on Tuesday  the NTSB said the self driving system s  operational design  was a contributing factor to the 2016 crash because it allows drivers to avoid steering or watching the road for lengthy periods of time that were  inconsistent  with warnings from Tesla  The NTSB said Tesla could have taken further steps to prevent the system s misuse  and faulted the driver for not paying attention and for  overreliance on vehicle automation    The agency said the Autopilot system operated as designed but did not do enough to ensure drivers paid adequate attention  On some roads  drivers could use Autopilot at up to 90 miles  145 km  per hour  it said  Tesla did not ensure that the system was used only on highways and limited access roads  as recommended in the owner s manual  a fact that Sumwalt noted   The NTSB recommended that automakers monitor driver attention in ways other than through detecting steering wheel engagement  The system could not reliably detect cross traffic and  did little to constrain the use of autopilot to roadways for which it was designed   the board said   TEN SECONDS TO REACT  Monitoring driver attention by measuring the driver s touching of the steering wheel  was a poor surrogate for monitored driving engagement   said the board   Tesla said in June 2016 that Autopilot  is not perfect and still requires the driver to remain alert    At a public hearing Tuesday on the crash involving Brown  NTSB said the truck driver and the Tesla driver  had at least 10 seconds to observe and respond to each other   Brown s family said on Monday the car was not to blame for the crash   We heard numerous times that the car killed our son  That is simply not the case   the family s statement said   There was a small window of time when neither Joshua nor the Tesla features noticed the truck making the left hand turn in front of the car    People die every day in car accidents   the statement said   Change always comes with risks  and zero tolerance for deaths would totally stop innovation and improvements   A spokeswoman for Tesla and a lawyer for the family  Jack Landskroner  have declined to say if the automaker has reached a legal settlement with the Brown family   NTSB recommended that NHTSA require automakers to have safeguards to prevent the misuse of semi autonomous vehicle features  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  said it would review the findings of the safety board   
In January  NHTSA said it found no evidence of defects in the crash  NHTSA and NTSB said Brown did not apply the brakes  and his last action was to set the cruise control at 74 miles per hour  119 kph   less than 2 minutes before the crash   above the 65 mph speed limit ",2017-09-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ntsb-operational-limitations-played-major-rule-in-tesla-autopilot-crash-527867,527867

259265,DIS,FCC opens probe into Sinclair disclosures on failed Tribune deal,news,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Federal Communications Commission has opened a new investigation into whether Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc engaged in misrepresentations or a lack of candor in its failed effort to win approval for a  3 9 billion bid to purchase Tribune Media Co 
In a June 25 letter to Sinclair posted Wednesday on the FCC s website  the government agency directed Sinclair to answer a series of questions and provide documents by July 9  warning that  failing to respond accurately and completely to this  letter  constitutes a violation of the act and our rules  
Sinclair did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment 
An administrative judge in March dropped a hearing into allegations that Sinclair  the largest U S  broadcast station owner  may have misled regulators  Judge Jane Halprin added however that the allegations  are extremely serious charges that reasonably warrant a thorough examination  
Tribune terminated the sale of 42 TV stations in 33 markets to Sinclair  which has 192 stations  in August  A month earlier the FCC referred the deal for a hearing  questioning Sinclair s candor over the planned sale of some stations and suggesting Sinclair would effectively retain control over them 
The collapse of the deal  which was backed by U S  President Donald Trump  potentially ended Sinclair s hopes of building a national conservative leaning TV powerhouse that might have rivaled Twenty First Century Fox Inc s Fox News 
Sinclair in March said it continues  to maintain that we were completely candid  transparent and honest with the FCC during its review of our proposed acquisition of Tribune Media  
Andrew Schwartzman  a law professor at Georgetown University  said the FCC could have waited to address the issues when Sinclair s licenses were up for renewal  but said the inquiry was  inevitable  given the FCC s prior findings 
After the deal collapsed  the FCC s Enforcement Bureau said it did not oppose dismissal of the hearing proceeding 
Nexstar Media Group Inc said in December it will buy Tribune in a  4 1 billion deal that would make it the largest regional U S  TV station operator  The deal is still under review by the Justice Department and the FCC 
Democrats accused Sinclair of slanting news coverage in favor of Republicans  Trump last year criticized the Republican led FCC for not approving the Tribune deal  saying on Twitter it  would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People  
In 2017  the FCC said it was fining Sinclair  13 38 million after it failed to properly disclose that paid programming that aired on local TV stations was sponsored by a cancer institute 
In the latest inquiry  Sinclair could face new fines 
In May  Walt  Disney   NYSE DIS  Co said it would sell its interests in 21 regional sports networks and Fox College Sports to Sinclair for  9 6 billion ",2019-06-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fcc-opens-probe-into-sinclair-disclosures-on-failed-tribune-deal-1908891,1908891

Both candidates also have robust  well funded campaigns and strong claims on this state  which holds the first Democratic presidential nominating contest in February 
That has some voters preoccupied with a question  is Iowa  or the presidential field in general  big enough for two popular progressives running head to head  or is there a risk that they could split the vote on the left  to the benefit of a centrist such as former vice president Joe Biden 
 Of course it concerns me   said Sherma Mather  50  who was visiting the fair from Richmond  Virginia  to support Warren 
Although the field is unsettled with the Iowa caucuses still nearly six months away  early opinion polls have consistently shown Biden in the lead with either Sanders  of Vermont  or Warren  of Massachusetts  in second place 
The fact that combining support for Sanders and Warren would eclipse Biden s buttresses progressives  arguments that the party is lurching leftward 
 They are a 1 2 punch and they are having a gravitational pull on the rest of the field   said Adam Green  co founder of the Progressive  NYSE PGR  Change Campaign Committee  PCCC   an advocacy group that supports Warren 
Two dozen Democrats are competing to secure their party s nomination and battle Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 general election 
Sanders and Warren insist they are friends  not rivals  And they have so far stayed true to their pledge not to turn on each other for political gain  as moderate candidates warn that their reformist agenda will only ensure Trump s re election 
In Iowa  which has an outsized role in picking presidential nominees  there are signs that Warren could be chipping away at some of Sanders  long held support on the left 
A recent poll by Monmouth University of Iowa Democrats showed Warren in second place with 21  of the vote  trailing Biden by just seven percentage points  Sanders had dropped to 9  in the state  according to the poll 
Advisers to Sanders on Monday said the survey was flawed on the grounds his supporters were undersampled 
Nationally  the news is better for him  with Sanders and Warren basically neck and neck behind Biden  The most recent Reuters Ipsos poll had Sanders in second place by a wide margin over Warren 
Sanders  can make a case for himself at this juncture how he is a unique candidate without denigrating others   said his campaign manager Faiz Shakir 
Warren s campaign declined to comment for this story 
Watching Sanders at the state fair on Sunday  Alexis Johnson  33  of Des Moines  said beating Trump was her top priority as a voter and expressed little enthusiasm for Warren 
 It s going to Bernie or Biden  I feel like   she said   And Bernie s my man  
Misty Cornelius  38  of Des Moines  was sporting a Sanders tattoo on her chest at the fair  but she said Warren might be a better choice against Trump 
 Bernie has been stigmatized   she said   Warren is a fresh face  
DIFFERENT APPEAL
Despite sharing many of the same talking points  the two are noticeably different on the stump 
Drawing upon her working class Oklahoma roots  Warren casts herself as a sort of prairie populist  while Sanders talks more in terms of leading a  movement  
There is evidence too that the two do not chase the same kind of voters 
Patrick Murray  the polling director at Monmouth  said while  there is ideological overlap   Warren s recent surge has her pulling support away from virtually every other candidate  not just Sanders 
 Sanders has core support that will not desert him   Murray said  That grassroots support led Sanders in 2016 to battle the eventual nominee Hillary Clinton to the very end of the primaries 
But Warren may have appeal to women  particularly college educated women  that Sanders cannot match   I am sick and tired of men running the world   said Janet Caldwell  66  of Washington  Iowa 
Sanders  campaign in fact views Biden as their primary challenge  because both are courting the kind of working class voters and union voters who gravitated to Trump in 2016 
Biden did little in Iowa to boost his status as a front runner  He made several gaffes  including when he said in a speech that  poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids    a sensitive slip up in an election where race is in the spotlight 
Also waiting in the wings in Iowa is U S  Senator Kamala Harris of California  who ranked third in the state in the Monmouth poll with 11  support 
After Iowa  Sanders and Warren will clash in New Hampshire  which holds the first Democratic primary later in February 
Many Warren voters  like Mather of Richmond  fear Sanders will not yield if his fellow senator continues to gain momentum 
Right now  the foremost concern of the two campaigns is not to siphon support off the other  Instead  they both want to convince large swaths of voters that a progressive Democrat can win the election against Trump  the PCCC s Green said 
 Many  electability voters  are parked in Joe Biden s column   Green said   but that perception is changing  ",2019-08-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/as-2020-race-heats-up-growing-worries-warren-and-sanders-will-split-leftist-vote-1953450,1953450

Reports for Alphabet  Amazon and Johnson   JohnsonThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Alphabet  Amazon and Johnson   Johnson  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Alphabet s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet Services industry year to date   27 6  vs  9 5    The Zacks analyst believes that the company s strong focus on innovation of AI techniques and the home automation space should aid business growth in the long term  Also  its strong focus on bolstering presence in the cloud market is encouraging Alphabet reported weak third quarter earnings due to heavy investment in cloud computing and hardware businesses  However  Google s robust mobile search is a positive  Notably  it has agreed to acquire Fitbit for roughly  2 1 billion This deal will likely help the company to accelerate innovation in the wearables category  However  the company s growing litigation issues and competition might hurt profitability Shares of Amazon have lost 6 4  in the past six months against S P 500 s rise of 9 6   The Zacks analyst believes that the company benefited from solid Prime momentum owing to robust grocery services and strong content portfolio  Moreover  Prime Free One Day service helped Amazon in gaining traction across customers  Further  strengthening AWS services and its growing adoption rate contributed well to the third quarter results  Improving Alexa skills and features remains a major positive  Expanding smart home products offerings are tailwinds However  rising transportation cost related to its free one day shipping service remains an overhang and is likely to escalate further  Amazon also expects foreign exchange headwinds to continue impacting the top line Johnson   Johnson s shares have gained 2  over the past three months against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s rise of 6 3   The Zacks analyst believes that J J is witnessing significant generic biosimilar headwinds in the Pharma unit in 2019 However  the unit is performing above market levels supported by contribution from new drugs like Tremfya and successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and immunology drug  Stelara  J J is also making rapid progress with its pipeline line extensions  It has already gained FDA approval for two new drugs in 2019  Balversa and Spravato Share buybacks and restructuring initiatives should provide bottom line support  However  headwinds like biosimilar generic competition and pricing pressure remain  Moreover  J J faces numerous lawsuits  which allege personal injuries to patients caused by the use of its products Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Boeing and PetroChina 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released  Experts distill 7

271957,AAPL,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Google  Fitbit  Apple  Facebook And Amazon,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 19  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Google   NASDAQ GOOGL    Fitbit   NYSE FIT    Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Google   Fitbit   Antitrust ConcernsOn November 1st  Google announced it would acquire smart wearables company Fitbit for  2 1 billion  This price represents a considerable discount from the  10 billion market cap that FIT was trading at following its IPO in mid 2015  This stock has done nothing but break down since  as consumer demand for the product faded Fitbit watches were all the hype in wearable technology before the Apple Watch release in 2015  which seemed to shift consumer focus  The Apple Watch was a device that seamlessly integrated with the US s favorite smartphone  the iPhone  and has been taking a substantial amount of market share from Fitbit Consumer Concerns So the question remains  why would Google acquire a firm with a dying product  Some think this is a play for Google to gain more consumer data on anyone wearing one of these devices  This idea has caused quite a few people to set down their Fitbit watches for the last time This is following Google s promise to customers that they would never sell anyone s personal or health information At the end of the day  Google is a data business and is likely purchasing Fitbit to collect data from users  Whether this is good or bad for consumers remains to be seen I personally think that this is going to make Fitbit products cheaper and more functional  There use of my data will likely improve functionality Google and The Internet of Things  IoT Google has been building out its IoT capabilities with its Google IoT platform  which  provides a complete solution for collecting  processing  analyzing  and visualizing IoT data in real time to support improved operational efficiency   according to the company s site Alphabet also provides developers with an easy to use platform called Android Things  formerly known as Brillo   which offers innovators with  a turnkey solution for building devices  Google has now been purchasing IoT device companies like Nest and Fitbit to entrench itself into the space  IoT has an enormous amount of potential future profitability with its integrative capabilities being pushed even further with the rollout of 5G  which is unraveling over the next few years Regulatory ConcernsCompanies like Google  Facebook and Amazon are under the regulatory microscope as they all dominate the space they operate in  with no close competitors  Regulatory bodies have been investigating these large tech conglomerates for years  searching for some ill practice they can use to break these giants up The more these companies acquirer and the larger they get  the more regulatory bodies will focus on them  Google has been slammed with a combined  9 5 billion in fines from the EU since 2017 for antitrust violations  with most of these having to do with anti competitive behavior US regulators have been much more lenient on their Silicon Valley stars  as these firms have been driving innovation and propelling the US economy  This is all about to change as US regulators begin to redefine the antitrust laws Who will prosper from these regulatory changes  Will the new laws inhibit only the big players  ability to control more of the market  or will it also impede new entrances from being competitive in the tech space  There is a balance that these regulators must reach Take AwayFitbit is just one more small piece in the giant Google puzzle that may be getting too large  Google is well positioned to take on 5G s next wave of IoT tech  but will regulatory efforts inhibit its potential returns Keep an eye out for any regulation news regarding these tech companies  as this may have a material effect on your holdings Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices  In the process  it s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3 trillion in activity A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech  Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  in the 1990s  Zacks  just released special report reveals 8

After an aggressive stance in 2018  the Federal Reserve has become dovish  reflecting a slower U S  economy  The Fed is projected to stay on the sidelines and maintain rates at a range between 2 25 2 50 percent  The Fed hasn t raised rates since December and has signaled that it could freeze rates until next year  The most recent inflation numbers will reinforce that stance  as the Fed target of 2 0  remains elusive  The Core PCE Price Index  which is the Federal Reserve s preferred gauge for inflation  came in at 0 0  in March and 0 1  in February  the two events were released on Tuesday due to the government shutdown earlier this year   On an annualized basis  the indicator gained 1 6   just shy of the estimate of 1 7   GDP and consumer spending are looking bright  but nonetheless there is no danger of the economy overheating  so the Fed can afford to leave rates at the current level for the near future

330334,HMC,Blindsided by SUV boom  Hyundai Motor trims costs  perks,news,"By Hyunjoo Jin SEOUL  Reuters    Headed for a fourth straight annual profit decline   Hyundai Motor   KS 005380  is trimming its cost fat  scaling back on business class flights and annual family home trips for overseas employees  executives told Reuters  The South Korean automaker has been hit by its exposure to weak emerging markets  and a product line up that features more sedans than sport utility vehicles  just as SUVs have become more popular across many global markets  The belt tightening   which also includes cutting back on printing and fluorescent light bulbs   aims to buy Hyundai time to prepare new models and a design revamp   We re trying to address a mismatch between the market trend and our product line up   said one Hyundai insider  referring to a need for more SUV models   That s a longer term plan  For now we re trying to save every penny   he said  declining to be identified because the plans are not public  Since October  Hyundai Motor Group executives have taken a 10 percent pay cut  the first such move in seven years  The number of executives at Hyundai Motor alone has risen by 44 percent in five years  to 293 last year   The group has also downgraded hotel rooms for executive travel  and is encouraging video conferencing as a cheaper alternative to travel  insiders said   We re in emergency management mode   said another insider  who didn t want to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media  In a response to Reuters for this article  Hyundai Motor said it is  making various cost saving efforts   with shrinking global demand and growing business uncertainty  but did not elaborate  Other costs  such as low margin supplier parts and labor at the heavily unionized automaker  are tougher to pare back  said Ko Tae bong  analyst at Hi Investment   Securities  noting Hyundai needs also to spend more on research and development in self driving and other new technologies  While Hyundai remains cash rich  its costs as a proportion of revenue have risen for five straight years  to 81 percent so far this year  regulatory filings show   Cutting expenses are stopgap measures  and won t do much to improve its bottom line   Ko said  calling them more  symbolic   SALES DECLINE Hyundai grew quickly after the global financial crisis  with brisk sales of its Sonata and Elantra sedans  It was the only major automaker to increase sales in the United States in 2009  But it has struggled to maintain that momentum as rivals  sales of SUVs have boomed and emerging market economies have weakened  Hyundai Motor shares have fallen 40 percent in the past three years  the worst performer among global automakers  The automaker s top U S  executive has resigned  and the South Korea sales chief and China head have been replaced  Sales of Hyundai cars  and those of its affiliate Kia Motors  KS 000270   could drop to 8 million this year  a first decline since Hyundai bought its smaller domestic rival in 1998  said Ko  the analyst  For next year  Hyundai Kia Executive Vice President and research head Park Hong jae  expects sales to pick up again   It was a difficult year this year  Things will get better   he told reporters on Thursday  citing recovery in markets such as Brazil and Russia  Another Hyundai source said the group has trimmed its preliminary 2017 sales target to 8 2 million vehicles  from 8 35 million forecast in mid year  MORE SUVS While it looks to manage its staff budget  Hyundai is beefing up its SUV offerings  freshening up its Sonata sedan  and redirecting exports from slow demand markets such as the Middle East to the United States  In the United States  SUVs accounted for 28 percent of Hyundai s sales in January November  up from 23 percent a year earlier  according to Autodata Corp  but less than half the industry average  At its plant in Montgomery  Alabama  Hyundai has replaced some Sonata production with its popular Santa Fe SUV  Next year  Hyundai will look to plug a gap in its SUV offerings for developed markets by making a sub compact model   under the project name  OS    in South Korea for sale at home  in the United States and Europe  people inside the company said  Hyundai makes sub compact SUVs locally in China  India and Russia   We need that small SUV in the U S  much sooner than later   Scott Fink  one of Hyundai s biggest U S  dealers  told Reuters  In sedans  Hyundai is pushing sales of bigger  higher margin models like the Azera  or Grandeur  and its Genesis luxury line  Its smaller sedans  including the Elantra and Sonata  have lost ground to rivals like Honda Motor s  T 7267  Civic  which one Hyundai executive said has  wowing design   Hyundai is working on a next generation of cars with  a different flair  to hit the market from 2019  Luc Donckerwolke  senior vice president for design  told Reuters on the sidelines of a recent event  The biggest holder of Hyundai Motor preferred shares  the Norway based Skagen Kon Tiki fund  expects the automaker to get back on track over the next couple of years  with new SUVs  recovering emerging market currencies and better plant utilization

If you re looking for a good company to start your investment portfolio with  look no further than Walt Disney  NYSE DIS  
The company s record breaking year looks set to continue as its latest addition  Frozen 2  raked in  350 million globally on its opening weekend    an all time record for an animated movie  The much anticipated sequel to the hugely popular kids  movie is now expected to be Disney s sixth movie in 2019 to break the  1 billion mark 
Disney s stock price jumped past the  150 mark earlier in the week and continued to rise on the news of its latest successes  Frozen 2 looks set to bring Disney s box office haul to more than  9 billion in 2019  in what has been a year unlike any before it  Not only has this summer s Avengers  Endgame become the highest grossing movie of all time  but Star Wars  The Rise of Skywalker    which is not out until Dec  19    has already dwarfed the Marvel blockbuster s pre ticket sales take  

To put Disney s 2019 into context  It has accounted for more than a third of the total U S  film market this year alone  
Disney is more than just movies   
Of course  we know that Disney doesn t just make movies  but has also embarked on one of its most ambitious ventures in Disney   The streaming service will be causing the folks at Netflix to sweat a little after it was reported last week that it is averaging nearly a million new subscribers a day  With 10 million subscribers after just two days  Disney really seems to be intent on winning the streaming wars  
Elsewhere  Disney s often overlooked resort revenue has also been soaring of late  bringing in  26 2 billion in fiscal 2019  up 6  from last year s haul of  24 7 billion  The ongoing growth of Disney across all sectors seems to indicate that the House of Mouse will not be slowing down any time soon

    What s Hurting Grainger Shares of Grainger have been falling and lost around 11 5  since it reported first quarter 2017 results on Apr 18  Adjusted earnings per share declined 9  year over year  owing to the adverse effect of strategic pricing initiatives in the U S  and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate Due to stronger than anticipated positive customer response to the U S  strategic pricing actions  Grainger decided to accelerate its pricing actions this year instead of 2018  However  the decision requires a significant reduction to the company s earnings per share guidance for 2017 Thus  Grainger lowered its 2017 sales and earnings per share guidance  The company now guides sales growth of 1 4   down from the earlier guidance of 2 6   It also estimates earnings per share to be in the range of  10 00  11 30 compared to the previous band of  11 30  12 40 With the acceleration of Grainger s pricing actions from 2018 into third quarter 2017  the company now projects U S  price deflation of 5  for the year and a gross margin contraction of 210 basis points in 2017  The price acceleration is a headwind to 2017 and 2018 gross margins Further  Grainger s Canada segment remains a concern  The segment continues to be challenged due to elevated expenses  In addition  the company s oil and gas  and energy exposure in Canada is very high  Thus  fluctuation in oil prices will hamper the segment s results Downward Estimate RevisionsFor the full year  nine estimates have moved down over the past 60 days compared with no upward revisions  This has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  moving down from earnings of  11 87 a share 60 days ago to its current level of  10 53 Also  for the current quarter  Grainger has seen seven downward estimate revisions versus no upward revision  which dragged the consensus estimate down to earnings of  2 69 a share from  3 04 cents over the past 60 days    These above mentioned factors make us skeptical about the performance of Grainger in the near term Stock to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks worth considering in the same sector are AGCO Corporation   NYSE AGCO    Altra Industrial Motion Corp    NASDAQ AIMC   and Parker Hannifin Corporation   NYSE PH    All the three stocks boast a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see AGCO has an average positive earnings surprise of 40 39  for the trailing four quarters  Altra Industrial Motion generated an average positive earnings surprise of 15 93  over the past four quarters  while Parker Hannifin has an average positive earnings surprise of 14 94  for the last four quarters Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ",2017-05-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/grainger-(gww)-hits-52-week-low:-what's-dragging-it-down-200189972,200189972

405968,GS,Lower recovery rates to haunt U S  leveraged loans,news,By Yun Li and Jonathan Schwarzberg NEW YORK  LPC    Overwhelming demand for floating rate leveraged loans has eroded credit quality and will lead to more defaults and lower recovery rates in an economic downturn  according to ratings agency Moody s  Leveraged loans have become the go to instrument of choice to finance private equity buyouts  due to their flexibility and lack of repayment penalties  but the ratings agency is warning that investors are sacrificing credit protection as more lower rated companies tap the markets   Average first lien term loan recoveries are expected to tumble to 61 percent from an average of 77 percent historically and average recoveries for second lien loans will fall to 14 percent from 43 percent historically  bringing heavier losses for investors  according to Moody s   The prevalence of senior loan only structures  which lack a cushion of junior debt  is expected to be a major factor in lower recovery rates and could produce an extended default cycle  according to the ratings agency    The result is more defaults than the last downturn as well as lower recoveries  undercutting a foundational premise for investing in loans   said Christina Padgett  a senior vice president at Moody s   The move to bond style covenant lite structures with little investor protection has further boosted the appeal of loans  More than 70 percent of syndicated US leveraged loans are now covenant lite  compared with 25 percent during 2006 2007  according to Thomson Reuters LPC   Loans are becoming more bond like with these convergence trends causing investors to lose more control over debt terms and credit protections   Moody s said in a note published August 16  Around  891 billion of US leveraged loans have been issued as of August 14  which is already 6 9 percent higher than last year s record of  833 7 billion in the same period  High yield bond issuance  on the other hand  has slumped 28 percent to  116 billion compared to  161 billion in the same period in 2017   Wall Street has met the demand with increased supply of loans versus high yield bonds  but we are concerned about the erosion of traditional lender protection   said Brian Juliano  head of US bank loans at PGIM Fixed Income   I do think that some of the covenants are merging towards traditional high yield bond covenants   The loan market added  73 5 billion in July as the US summer doldrums approached and business has been unseasonably brisk in the August holiday period   This week specialty materials company Boyd Corp wrapped up a  1 3 billion first lien loan and a  315 million second lien loan to finance its acquisition by Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  Merchant Banking and last week healthcare data analytics company Verscend Technologies lined up a  3 165 billion term loan to finance its purchase of analytics provider Cotiviti Holdings   LOWER RATED  Loans are traditionally rated higher than bonds due to seniority in the capital structure  but lower quality loans are rising  CCC rated loans now total 5 4 percent of leveraged loans as opposed to 3 5 percent just before the credit crisis in 2008  according to an August 15 report from UBS     B  rated loan volume totaled  39 1 billion through August 16  up 90 7 percent over the same period in 2017 when volume totaled  20 5 billion  according to Thomson Reuters LPC data  and CCC rated loan volume added up to  3 2 billion over the same time period  up 23 1 percent over  2 6 billion in 2017  The share of first time debt issuers rated B3 reached a record 43 percent in the first half of 2018  and about 64 percent of US speculative grade companies have a corporate family rating of B2 or lower  according to Moody s   Ethics and compliance management services provider NAVEX Global wrapped up pricing last week on a  639 million covenant lite credit facility to support an investment by BC Partners  Although the  154 million second lien portion of the deal is rated only CCC  the issuer still managed to drop pricing to 700 over Libor from guidance in the 750bp 775bp over Libor range    Part of the reason for lower ratings is driven by the rise in loan only capital structures   UBS said in the report   UBS estimates that 40 percent of the leveraged loan index is composed of loan only capital structures now with 60 percent of B and CCC rated companies supported solely by loans  NAVEX Global s loan has no bonds  for example    We believe the prevalence of loan only and cov lite loans will make rating migration risks from B to CCC elevated as limited debt cushions and greater collateral uncertainty elevate potential credit losses   UBS wrote  A portfolio manager said that they are now investing on the assumption that there will be no junior debt cushion below the senior loans  This is fostering a more cautious approach      It s a concern  especially without covenants   the manager said   It has led us to stay away from some cyclical companies  ,2018-08-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lower-recovery-rates-to-haunt-us-leveraged-loans-1578531,1578531
385778,HD,Home Depot  HD  Stock Climbs On Strong Sales Volume,opinion,"Home Depot Inc  N HD 
Home Depot is having an incredible day in the market today  and for good reason  The company recently reported earnings  blowing away all expectations and proving strong sales volume  Today  we ll talk about what we saw from the earnings report  how the market reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from HD moving forward  So  let s get right to it 
HD Reports Strong Earnings
As mentioned above  Home Depot reported its earnings for the fourth quarter before the opening bell this morning  and the report proved to be overwhelmingly positive  Here s what we saw 
Earnings Per Share   In terms of earnings per share  HD blew away expectations  While analysts expected that the company would produce  1 10 per share in the fourth quarter  the company actually announced earnings in the amount of  1 17 per share  This also proved to be growth of around 16  year over year 
Revenue   Top line revenue also proved to be a big hit  In the quarter  the company produced revenue in the amount of  21 billion  also proving growth in the double digits 
The Big Story   While beating earnings and producing solid growth in revenue is great news  there s one piece of the earnings report that investors seem to be more excited about than anything else  That is sales growth  In the fourth quarter  the rebound in US homes sales led to massive gains in sales for Home Depot  In fact  HD saw growth in sales in the amount of 9 5  in the quarter 
Looking at the information above  its clear that HD had an incredibly positive quarter  In a statement  Brian Nagel  senior equity research analyst at Oppenheimer   Co  had the following to say with regard to the report 

 The key with Home Depot is that they kept warm weather product in the stores longer  and then as the weather shifted  they got the snow shovels  ice melt  generators  whatever else in their stores quickly  so they were really able to take advantage of what was for a while an odd weather environment  

How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we ve learned that the news moves the market  More importantly  we ve learned that few pieces of news have the ability to move the market quite like earnings  When a publicly traded company produces positive earnings  we can expect to see strong gains in the value of the stock associated with that company  So naturally  we re seeing strong gains in the value of HD at the moment  Currently  12 17   the stock is trading at  124 97 after a gain of  2 12 per share or 1 73  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have a relatively mixed opinion of what we can expect to see from HD  First and foremost  earnings in the fourth quarter were incredibly positive  With that said  we can expect to see gains in the short term as investor excitement fuels growth  However  in the long run  things may turn out a bit different  One of the big pushers for HD sales in the quarter were strong new home sales in the US  This figure has been declining as of late  On top of that  HD also benefited from the strange weather in the beginning of he winter  This isn t likely to be the case through the first quarter  So  things will likely get very interesting upon the next earnings release 
What Do You Think 
Where do you think HD is headed moving forward  Let us know your opinion in the comments below ",2016-02-23,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/home-depot-(hd)-stock-climbs-on-strong-sales-volume!-200119278,200119278
407299,GS,Oil prices fall on higher U S  crude inventories,news,"By Christopher Johnson LONDON  Reuters    Oil prices fell on Thursday as U S  fuel inventories rose despite efforts by OPEC to cut production  Brent crude oil  LCOc1  was down 75 cents at  56 19 a barrel by 1340 GMT  U S  light crude  CLc1  was  1 00 lower at  50 30  Both benchmarks have risen more than 20 percent from their lows in June as world oil markets tightened  U S  crude stocks rose by 3 1 million to 468 5 million barrels last week  according to the American Petroleum Institute   Official U S  inventory data was due to be published later on Thursday by the Energy Information Administration  EIA    The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers  including Russia  agreed last year to reduce output by 1 8 million barrels per day  bpd  to prop up prices  The cuts have helped deplete global fuel inventories  but stocks are still high and well above the five year average  a target that OPEC has said it wants to reach in order to balance the market  High U S  production is pushing increasing volumes of U S  crude into world markets  feeding inventories and undermining OPEC s efforts to tighten the market   The International Energy Agency said on Thursday demand for OPEC oil would be 32 5 million bpd next year   around 150 000 bpd lower than the group pumped last month   Carsten Fritsch  commodities analyst at Commerzbank  DE CBKG  in Frankfurt  said the tone of the IEA report was bearish because it suggested that demand for OPEC crude next year would not be sufficient to absorb all the available supplies   This means OPEC must deepen its production cuts to finish its job of bringing oil stocks back to the five year average   Fritsch said  The OPEC led deal helped lift oil from below  30 a barrel early last year  But traders say supplies remain ample and OPEC is widely expected to extend its cuts beyond the current expiry date of end March 2018   There is little doubt that leading producers have re committed to do whatever it takes to underpin the market   the IEA said in a report on Thursday  Many analysts expect Brent to stay between  50 and  60 a barrel as long as global markets stay balanced   Our updated global supply demand balance     shows peak stock draws in 3Q17   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  said in a note to clients

319105,AA,FOREX Euro hits 15 mo high vs dollar  yen  Swiss franc up,news,"  China committed to buying Spanish debt  boosts euro
   Yen  Swiss franc big gainers as well in risk off market
   Japan nuclear situation deteriorates
  Recasts  adds quote  updates prices  changes dateline 
previous LONDON and byline 
 By Gertrude Chavez Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK  April 12  Reuters    The euro rose to a fresh
15 month high against the dollar above  1 45 on Tuesday 
boosted by reported buying from China and news the world s
second largest economy was willing to purchase more Spanish
debt 
 The euro s break above  1 45 was a bullish signal  which
could open a test of  1 4550 and  1 4580  Both levels are said
to be lined with option barriers 
  The euro is being supported by expectations of higher
interest rates and news that China has reiterated its
commitment to buy European debt   said Camilla Sutton  chief
currency strategist  at Scotia Capital Markets in Toronto 
  That China news helped drive Spanish yields lower and was
positive for the euro  
 Spanish 10 year yields have fallen to 5 18 percent on
Tuesday from a recent high of 5 55 percent on March 10 
 The yen and Swiss franc were the two other big movers of
the day  rising after Japan s nuclear situation worsened and
Alcoa missed revenue estimates  prompting investors to sell
risky assets funded by the two low yielding currencies 
 Gains in both the yen and Swiss franc  were likely to be
short lived as demand for so called carry trades financed by
those two units may pick up again should the situation in Japan
improve 
 The yen rose for a fourth straight session  partly
retracing 10 consecutive days of losses versus the U S  dollar 
The Swiss franc also advanced for a fourth straight day 
 The initial sell off in risk was prompted by Japan s
Nuclear Safety Agency raising the severity rating of the
Fukushima accident to level 7    the highest classification and
the same as the world s worst nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in
1986  
 News that revenues from Alcoa Inc   the largest U S 
aluminum producer  missed Wall Street s target and leading to a
steep drop in the company s share price  also dented risk
sentiment 
 Both the Japan and Alcoa news led some speculators to book
profits on carry trades  where investments in riskier assets
and higher yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar
are funded by going short on the low yielding yen 
 In early New York trading  the euro reversed losses to
trade 0 5 percent higher on the day at  1 4510  after earlier
hitting a fresh 15 month peak at  1 4518 on electronic trading
platform EBS 
 Investors took out option barriers at  1 4500 and stops at
 1 4510 12 
 Against the yen  the euro was down 0 1 percent at 122 02 
recovering from a low of 120 16 yen hit earlier in the day  The
Australian dollar also pared losses against the yen as did
other growth linked currencies as investors bought at lower
levels 
 Short yen positions and key technical indicators in the
euro yen and Aussie yen pairs had been indicating the chances
of a temporary pullback after their recent rally  With this
correction  some analysts said  the trend for broad yen
weakness was likely to be on more solid ground 
 The U S  dollar was down 0 7 percent at 84 01 yen paring
earlier losses after running into technical support at its
200 day moving average just below 83 50  Japanese real money
accounts were dollar yen buyers  while offers were reported at
84 50 
 Short term losses in the dollar versus the yen are still
likely  with a close below 84 41 51 yen adding to the
greenback s bearish bias 
 The dollar fell 1 3 percent against the Swiss franc to
0 89490  It earlier dropped to 0 89446  its lowest in more than
three weeks 
 The ICE Futures  dollar index  which tracks the greenback
against a basket of major currencies  was down 0 5 percent at
74 754  after hitting 74 704  its lowest since December 2009

275231,AAPL,Stocks Head Higher As Fed Signals Rate Cuts To Come,opinion,"Fed Hints At Rate Cut
Well as expected the Fed did nothing but took a big step towards signaling as many as TWO rate cuts  The good news from this meeting is that the Fed may be leaning on a weak inflation outlook for the future cuts and not slowing GDP growth  Had a slower economy been the reason the equity market may have taken the view differently 
In the chart below  we can see what that GDP outlook looks stable and unchanged 

But you can see the drop in PCE Inflation for this year and next  Those are pretty big reductions 

As a result  the 10 Year fell to its recent lows of around 2  

The dollar weakened too 

S P 500  SPY 
Equities price increased on the S P 500  To this point  everything seemed to work out as it should 

Don t Get Complacent
It leaves the S P 500 near its all time  and it would seem as if the market is locked and loaded on hitting those all time highs  Could something derail the rally  As we have learned in previous weeks  all it takes is one tweet  Does the risk for a surprise tweet rise as we approach all time highs  Yes  I believe it does  Remember the last time we reached all time highs in May  Trump pulled the tariff car on China  Is something else looming  Well  the President already said he isn t happy with the Euro  and it has an unfair advantage  wink wink  nod nod  Of course  I have no clue 
That being said 
I think the S P 500 continues its advance to a new record high  There is confirmation of G20 China US meeting  the Fed has confirmed it is on an easing path  earning seasons doesn t start for a few weeks  and even the economic calendar is quiet  It could be the perfect setup  At least for two weeks or so

Tesla  TSLA 
Tesla Inc  NASDAQ TSLA  has been consolidating nicely at  225 and is at another one of those do or die moments  There is a bullish rising triangle pattern that has formed  suggesting that the stock rises  However  there is a massive downtrend standing in the way at  237  That downtrend has been a severe source of resistance since December 
I think TSLA does break out in a significant way  this time around  The RSI has already broken its downtrend that also started in December  and I think it foretells of a big breakout for Tesla and push to  250 and potentially higher 

Amazon  AMZN 
Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  is getting ready to break out and rise to  1966 

Roku  ROKU 
ROKU continues to grind higher  but I hope you can see the pattern that is forming in the chart  To me  it appears to be a rising wedge  a bearish reversal  It is taking longer to happen than I thought  but it seems ROKU is heading for a pullback

Expect all eyes will be on the accompanying statement  updated forecasts  and Governor Poloz s tone  Markets seem to be expecting an overly  dovish  message  and while the Bank is indeed likely to appear cautious overall  it is unlikely to go as far as abandon its rate hike plans completely  Currently  the Loonie  C 1 3450  is getting very little love from eight month high oil prices

USD JPY   111 87  is still unable to break above the key  112 level with focus remaining on the upcoming Bank of Japan  BoJ  rate decision later this evening 
Overnight  Aussie Q1 CPI data missed expectations and registered its third consecutive reading below the RBA s target range of  2 3  and matched the lowest level since Q3 2016  Q Q   0 0  vs   0 2 e  Y Y   1 3  vs   1 5 e   The softer data has a number of analysts revising their outlook for the RBA and now expect a rate cut as soon as next month  A 0 7043  

5  German IFO survey continues the string of disappointing data for region 
Data this morning showed that German business sentiment deteriorated somewhat this month as the mood among manufacturers  worsened markedly   accordingly to the Ifo Institute 
 The German economy continues to lose steam   said Ifo president Clemens Fuest  after the Ifo business climate index unexpectedly slipped to 99 2 from a revised 99 7 points in March 
Market expectations were looking for a small increase to 99 9 or 100 for this month 
Note  The German economy has had a weak start to 2019  narrowly avoiding recession in H2 2018  a trend that prompted the government last week to slash its growth forecast for this year to  0 5  from an earlier estimate of  1 0   
The ZEW research institute s latest measure of economic expectations point to towards a  mild pickup  in economic activity in the coming months 
Net  the Ifo survey confirms that  the export driven industry is in recession  while the domestic economy remains rather healthy

284993,AAPL,5 Tech Mutual Funds To Buy On Apple s New IPhone Launch,opinion,On the 10th anniversary of iPhone  tech behemoth Apple Inc    NASDAQ AAPL   launched three new varieties of iPhones   iPhone 8  8 Plus and the high end iPhone X  Although shares of Apple declined following the launch of new iPhones  the company is expected to gain momentum post launch  Moreover  iPhone is expected to surpass  1 trillion in sales by the end of 2018 bolstered by iPhone X Starting from iPhone 4  Apple s share price has spiked before the release of almost every iPhone  only to dip immediately after launch  However  this decline is usually followed by an extended increase in share performance  Following these promising trends  investing in technology mutual funds with a significant holding in the iPhone maker and other tech giants will be a prudent decision Apple s Performance Pre and Post iPhone LaunchiPhone X is expected to be far better than its predecessors  featuring a 5 8 inch edge to edge OLED display for the first time  Additionally  it has no home button and sports facial recognition  augmented reality directions  new dual lens camera  and wireless charging There is also speculation that robust iPhone X sales will make Apple the first company to touch the  1 trillion valuation mark by the end of 2018  per a report by TheStreet  Currently  Apple s market cap is  823 billion  Its shares have increased about 37 6  year over year and hit a 52 week high of  164 9 A report issued by RBC Capital Markets compares Apple s price returns for the period of one  three and six months both before and after the launch of a new iPhone  Per the report  Apple s price performance was comparatively better during the six month period as compared with the three month and one month periods pre iPhone launch  However  performance before iPhone 5s and iPhone 6s releases slumped as Apple was slated to launch phones with slight upgrades instead of issuing devices with brand new designs After the launch of every iPhone  Apple s performance was initially far from satisfactory  Price performance in the first 30 day post launch of iPhone 4  4S  5 and 6 was negative  while prices rose slightly after the launch of iPhone 5S  6S and 7  However  price performance for the tech giant was strong after the first 180 days for most of the iPhones  Only in the case of iPhone 5  prices declined 35 4  after the first 160 days  This is because the company removed Google Maps from that iPhone series and replaced it with less dependable Apple Maps app Buy These 5 Technology

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Oct 9  Reuters    Investors  willingness to take
risk rose on Thursday but stocks pared gains a day after
coordinated global interest rate cuts gave some calm to jittery
markets worldwide and curbed the appeal of safe haven assets 
 Demand for government bonds  gold and low yielding
currencies    all recent beneficiaries of investors who have
scrambled for relative safety    fell 
 Oil traded little changed around  89 a barrel after a steep
slide this week in response to expectations that demand will
fall sharply if the global economy slides into recession 
 The yen fell broadly and higher yielding currencies bounced
as extreme risk aversion receded after key central banks around
the world cut rates on Wednesday in a coordinated response to
halt the worst global financial crisis in almost 80 years 
 U S  stocks initially rose as investors snapped up
beaten down shares after a six day slide on Wall Street pushed
the Dow down about 34 percent from a record peak a year ago on
Oct  9  2007  By mid morning in New York  however  the bounce
on profit taking fizzled and stocks were little changed 
 Shares of International Business Machines Corp  rose
2 percent after it posted solid profit  making it a top boost
to the Dow  Apple Inc   another tech bellwether  led
the Nasdaq with a 4 percent gain 
  What we re seeing is just a bear market rally   said Dave
Rovelli  managing director of U S  equity trading at Canaccord
Adams in New York   You could see a significant rally over the
next couple of days  The market is so oversold  
 Mid morning in New York  the Dow Jones industrial average
 was down 6 37 points  or 0 07 percent  at 9 251 73  The
Standard   Poor s 500 Index  was down 2 01 points  or
0 20 percent  at 982 93  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was
up 12 60 points  or 0 72 percent  at 1 752 93 
 The cost of interbank borrowing overnight cash fell in
response to the coordinated effort by financial authorities to
restore calm to jittery markets  The cost of dollar  euro and
sterling funds for the overnight rate all fell substantially 
although by less than one half percentage point 
 The rate cuts were aimed in large part at unclogging the
commercial paper market and keeping businesses humming 
 Meanwhile  the cost of borrowing dollars for any period
beyond the overnight rate rocketed  Three month dollar Libor
hit its highest this year as banks scrambled for greenbacks to
cover U S  currency positions and to fund dollar assets 
  We re not seeing any relief in term Libor fixings which
tells us that the rate cut has exclusively impacted on the
overnight market but it hasn t touched the Libor market at
all   said BNP Paribas rate strategist Alessandro Tentori 
  And that s not a very good sign   Tentori said 
 U S  Treasuries fell for a third straight day as debt
supply issues weighed on investor sentiment  while rising stock
prices on Wall Street sapped any safety bid for bonds 
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note  fell
30 32 in price to yield 3 77 percent  and the 2 year U S 
Treasury note  fell 7 32 in price to yield 1 67
percent  Bond prices and yields move inversely to each other 
 European stocks were higher  breaking a three session
losing streak  after fresh government and central bank action
to combat the financial crisis 
 The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
was little changed after rising around 1 5 percent 
 The low yielding yen fell from a three year high against
the euro and a six month peak versus the dollar that it hit the
previous day  although it later pared some losses 
  The stocks overnight had a bit of a rally     and that s
given the dollar yen a little of a boost   said Steven Butler 
director of FX trading at Scotia capital in Toronto 
 Against the yen  the dollar  was up 1 86 percent at
101 10  The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies 
with the U S  Dollar Index  up 0 32 percent at 81 174 
 The euro  rose 0 22 percent at  1 3659 
 Gold slipped as investors cashed in gains that took the
precious metal to a nine day high in the previous session 
 Spot gold prices  fell  24 95 to  881 55 an ounce 
  There are still a lot of speculative positions in the
market and some banks are taking profit to make up losses on
other markets   Commerzbank senior trader Michael Kempinski
said 
 Oil was lower  U S  light sweet crude oil  fell 40
cents to  88 55 a barrel 
 Stocks clung to small gains overnight in Asia  MSCI s index
of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan  rose 2 05
percent after a 9 percent tumble on Wednesday  its biggest

240885,INTC,U S  tech sector getting by without Facebook and Alphabet,news,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The technology sector appears to be doing just fine on Wall Street a week after it lost two of its highest profile components to a newly christened communication services group 
The S P 500 technology index  SPLRCT  has gained 1 3 percent since the start of last Monday  when  Facebook Inc   O FB  and Google parent Alphabet Inc  O GOOGL    half of the FANG group of hyper growth stocks that propelled Wall Street higher in recent years   were pushed out of technology and into the telecom sector  renamed  communication services  
During that short period of time  the technology index outperformed communication services and consumer discretionary  the third sector affected by the largest ever overhaul of the Global Industry Classification Standard 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  recommended on Monday that investors be overweight technology and underweight communication services and consumer discretionary 
 Old Tech represents a lot of what we like  net cash and healthy balance sheets  free cash flow generation  leverage to unit volume sales growth and low earnings risk   bank strategist Savita Subramanian wrote in a report 
Following the changes to GICS  Cisco Systems Inc  O CSCO  and  Intel Corp   O INTC  join  Visa Inc   N V    Microsoft Corp   O MSFT  and Apple Inc  O AAPL  as the tech sector s largest five components 
Mature companies with storied histories compared to many of their Silicon Valley neighbors  Cisco and Intel have struggled to grow in recent years  but they deliver steady earnings and return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks 
Netflix Inc  O NFLX   another FANG stock  was moved from consumer discretionary to communication services as part of the reshuffle  It has since rallied nearly 6 percent  helping push the communication services index 1 percent higher 
Up 20 percent so far in 2018  technology may benefit from the absence of Alphabet and Facebook  which have underperformed due to worries about regulation in response to criticism of their handling of user data 
Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   the fourth FANG stocks  remains in consumer discretionary and is now the only part of FANG not in the communication services sector

412153,PM,Opening Bell  Volatility Rules As Yields Rise  Yuan Drops  USD Pops,opinion,"VIX goes wild  closing at 1 year high
Stocks  bonds correlate
Equities sold off at end of day  signaling more selling ahead
NASDAQ Composite underperforms
US oil production jump pushes WTI down
Key Events
US equities were pressured again yesterday after Tuesday s miraculous recovery  which featured the S P 500 s strongest rally in 15 months and the Dow s biggest rally in 2 years 

But that was then  During yesterday s session  volatility  as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index  more commonly referred to as the VIX  extended Tuesday s fall from a 2   year high  reaching an intraday low of 21 22  its highest level since November 9  when markets reacted to the initial shock of an unexpected Trump victory in US elections  However  volatility rebounded as the day progressed to close higher  at 27 73  its highest level since February 2016  The index remains about 40 percent above its average since 1990 

The turbulence was spurred by the auction of US 10 year Treasury notes which found little demand  provoking bond traders still licking their wounds from last week s reversal of the supply demand balance that s been in place since late 2014 to increase supply  pushing the yield back above 2 8 percent 

In turn  equity traders  still nervous from the worst selloff in 6   years only two days earlier  joined bond traders and increased supply  The selloff  which began at 11 15 EST  was replaced by the two groups acting in harmony 
Prices ranged between 13 15 and 15 45  However  equity traders didn t want to remain exposed overnight and  as the close neared  inundated exchanges with sell orders  Volume spiked  topping 9 billion shares for a fourth straight day  the highest in seven months 
The rush to sell before the close ended the harmonious range and tipped the balance over to supply  pushing it below its uptrend line  suggesting a negative outlook  This pattern is true for all major US indices  save the Russell 2000  the only major index yesterday that was able to eke out a 0 1 percent advance 
Global Financial Affairs

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a bit below a rising channel  but not far enough to render a rebound unlikely  However  the daily volatility increases risk  as it swung 500 points from peak to trough 

The S P 500 dropped 0 50 percent  led by the Energy sector which fell 1 67 percent  Technology followed  down 1 28 percent  The only two sectors that eked out any gains were Industrials  which rose 0 18 percent  followed by Financials  which advanced 0 12 percent  The S P 500 erased an uptick that reached 1 2 percent at its highest  to close lower by 0 5 percent  It was the biggest reversal for the index since 2015 

The NASDAQ Composite  which is heavily weighted towards information technology companies  fared even worse  The heavy selling of mega cap technology shares pushed the index down by 0 9 percent  forming a bearish Rising Wedge  in which the harmonious range following the initial selloff is considered a downside breakout 
After yesterday s highly volatile 10 year Treasury yield activity  in which yields rose as high as 2 861 but fell as low as 2 758  only to close with much ado about nothing at 2 808  today yields have resumed their rise  sitting at 2 83  as of 04 20 EST  Exacerbating the aftershocks from the global equity selloff  the rising yield continues to confuse intermarket analysis  with European shares falling  Asian equities rising and US futures swinging from losses to gains 
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index Index opened lower this morning  with miners leading the retreat  Earlier  shares listed on Japan s TOPIX closed higher after a turbulent session while China stocks listed on the Shanghai Composite slumped for a third day even as Hong Kong equities listed on the Hang Seng climbed  S P 500 Futures were up after dropping earlier in Asian trading 
The yield surge sparked concern the Federal Reserve would accelerate its tightening schedule  slowing the economy and eroding corporate profit margins  Chicago Fed President Charles Evans signaled as much Wednesday  saying sustained inflation could force more hikes 
The reason the selloff wasn t worse is that investors have been trained to buy the dip  Many buyers are insisting that this time they re motivated not just by greed but by the continued solid fundamentals synchronized growth and strong corporate earnings 
Still  we can t help but wonder how much of this confidence is coming from investors who ve grown used to a Fed whose looser monetary policy has been nursing markets along  What will happen to those same investors once the Fed shuts off much of that liquidity  How many investors will continue to buy 
At the same time  an extended selloff will slowly but surely exhaust liquidation  leaving sellers with no buyers at current price levels  That would force them to seek willing buyers  at any price  or put more broadly  at any cost 

The dollar extended its rally into a 5th straight day  As of this writing it was trading at the height of the session  nearing the top of a falling channel 
Bloomberg s Basic Materials Index fell for a fourth day  its biggest drop since November 

WTI crude fell the most in two months  nearing an uptrend line since September  after government inventories data showed a jump in production  Gold futures slid  and copper futures tumbled more than 3 percent 
The pound was flat ahead of a Bank of England rate decision 

In Asia  the yuan fell the most since the currency s devaluation in August 2015  after China reported a much narrower than expected trade surplus as imports jumped  The country has resumed its Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership plan after a two year hiatus  granting licenses to about a dozen global money managers able to raise funds in China for overseas investments   on Thursday  citing unidentified sources  Increasing imports and overseas investment both contribute to a weaker currency 

Bitcoin s rebound remains under pressure since it fell from its uptrend line from the  6 000 low on Tuesday 
Up Ahead
A host of ECB speakers are on the schedule Thursday including Executive Board members Yves Mersch and Peter Praet 
The UK s monetary policy decision is due today as well  Mark Carney may flag more tightening this year if the economy remains on its current path  analysts also expect the BOE to upgrade its quarterly outlook

439315,XOM,UPDATE 9 Oil edges up in choppy trade  posts weekly gain,news,"  Fitch downgrades of Spain  Italy rattle markets
   U S  nonfarm payrolls data supportive to oil
   Coming up  API oil data  3 30 p m  EDT Wednesday
 Recasts  updates prices to settlement 
 By Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK  Oct 7  Reuters    Oil prices edged higher in
volatile trading on Friday and posted a weekly gain as
supportive U S  jobs data and a ratings downgrades of Spain and
Italy buffeted markets 
 Both Brent and U S  crude futures recovered late after
retreating when Fitch cut Spain s credit ratings minutes after
downgrading Italy  saying the intensification of the euro zone
debt crisis has hurt the entire region   ID nL5E7L72KC 
  Some late price recovery came after the shock that Spain
was included in the downgrades wore off   said Phil Flynn 
analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago 
  And there has been progress made with Europe moving to
implement their version of quantitative easing   Flynn added 
 The Fitch move followed Moody s ratings cut for British
banks Lloyds  and Royal Bank of Scotland  that
pressured oil prices ahead of the U S  jobs report 
 ID nL5E7L70H6 
 Both oil futures contracts rose on supportive U S  jobs
figures  though gains were limited because the return of
striking workers accounted for much of the improvement 
 Brent crude for November  edged up 15 cents to
settle at  105 88 a barrel  trading from  104 37 to  106 64 
 Brent ended 3 percent higher on the week  the best
percentage weekly gain since the week to July 8 
 U S  November crude  rose 39 cents to settle at
 82 98 a barrel  having traded between  81 36 and  84 
 U S  crude jumped 4 7 percent for the week  the best weekly
percentage rise since the week to March 4 
 U S  crude trading volumes were just 2 percent above the
30 day average while Brent volume was 9 percent under its
30 day average 
 JOBS GAINS SLIM  BUT SUPPORTIVE
 Nonfarm payrolls in the United States rose by 103 000 in
September  versus forecasts for 60 000  and job gains for the
prior months were revised higher   ID nOAT004877 
 But part of the strength of September s jobs number
reflected the return of 45 000 Verizon Communications workers
who had dropped off payrolls in August due to a strike 
 Excluding those workers  payrolls increased by 58 000  just
missing expectations

 U S  stocks fell after a choppy session  also feeling
pressure from the downgrades of Italy and Spain after the
supportive jobs data    N 
 The downgrades for Italy and Spain pulled the euro lower as
the anxiety about Europe s debt crisis persisted   USD  
 The dollar index  reversed and strengthened as the
euro s gains wilted  helping limit any price gains for
dollar denominated oil prices 
 EUROPE REMAINS FOCUS
 Both Brent and U S  crude posted strong gains the previous
two sessions  supported on Thursday by plans to shore up the
region s banks from the Bank of England and the European
Central Bank after Wednesday s sharp boost on news of falling
U S  oil inventories 
 If you flood the market with liquidity  that liquidity has
got to go somewhere   said Michael Hewson  an analyst at CMC
Markets    The moves by the two central banks  have made people
think it s only a matter of time before the Fed follows suit  I
think they could be waiting a long time for that to happen  
 Germany and France were split ahead of crucial talks on
Sunday over how to strengthen shaky European banks and fight
financial market contagion   ID nL5E7L714R

On top of reporting earnings growth  UnitedHealth reiterated its previously issued guidance for 2020  The company expects GAAP earnings per share between  15 45 and  15 75  along with non GAAP earnings per share between  16 25 and  16 55 
Shares of UnitedHealth spent much of 2019 in the doldrums  but began to recover sharply toward the end of the year  The healthcare stock is now up more than 33  over the past three months 
Analysts take sides on Apple
As Apple gears up to launch a 5G enabled iPhone later this year  analysts are largely lining up on the bullish side  That probably has something to do with the stock s recent performance  Shares of Apple gained 85  in 2019  and they re off to a strong start in 2020 
Another analyst jumped on the Apple train Wednesday morning  helping to push the stock up about 0 5   Canaccord Genuity already had a buy rating on Apple stock  which it reiterated  Canaccord also boosted its price target from  275 to  355 
There were a few reasons for the price target bump  First  the expectation that 5G will drive a strong upgrade cycle later this year and into 2021  Second  the possibility of Apple launching a low cost iPhone this year  replacing the iPhone SE  And third  continued growth in the services and wearables businesses 
There are still some analysts who don t share the same rosy view  On Tuesday  Atlantic Equities downgraded Apple from neutral to underweight  lowering its price target from  275 to  235  The rationale  Consumer demand for 5G is unclear  5G costs could pressure margins  and services and wearables are unlikely to have much of an impact on Apple s financials 
Investors will have a good idea which of these analyst camps are right when Apple reports its fiscal first quarter results on Jan  28 ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pifzv,2060274

281961,AAPL,Now s The Time To Buy This Discounted Tech Giant ,opinion,"When the market drops sharply  as it did last week  investors get the chance to buy great companies at a discount  This company has an unprecedented history of growth and profitability  along with a well deserved reputation as one of the most advanced and innovative companies in the world  Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   1 070 share  is this week s  

GOOGL Stands Alone

We ve written before that the   The best investments offer both growth   in the form of steadily increasing revenue  and value   in the form of a high return on invested capital     No company combines these two factors better than GOOGL  as shown in Figure 1 

Figure 1  GOOGL s Revenue and ROIC since 2008



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings

Those numbers are simply incredible when you consider GOOGL has never earned an ROIC below 25   the median S P 500 stock earns an ROIC of 8    The last time the firm grew revenue by less than 10  annually was in the depths of a recession in 2009 

Only two other S P 500 companies can match GOOGL s record of 25  or higher ROIC and double digit revenue growth for each of the past five years  These two companies  Align Technology Inc  NASDAQ ALGN  and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ REGN   both face looming patent cliffs  When it comes to sustainable growth and profitability  GOOGL has no equal 

GOOGL Has Little Competition In its Core Markets

In its core businesses  GOOGL has a market share that few other companies can match  In search  Google controls  75  of the market  In video  YouTube has a nearly 80  market share 

GOOGL s dominance compares favorably to the other highly touted FANG stocks  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  has an estimated 42  market share in social media  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  controls 44  of the e commerce market  Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  has a comparable 75  share of streaming households  but many consumers use Netflix along with competitors such as Prime Video  HBO Go  or Hulu  By comparison  few people are toggling back and forth between Google and Bing 

Google s dominance is also self reinforcing  Because it has the most users  websites have to optimize for its platform  which in turn makes its search results more useful than competitors   In addition  the larger volume of searches gives Google more data it can use to further refine its algorithm 

At this point  Google is fundamentally ingrained in the process of using the internet  As long as internet usage continues to grow at a rapid pace  which it should for the foreseeable future  GOOGL s profits will grow with it 

Continually Investing in the Future

GOOGL s profitability is all the more remarkable when one considers how much money the company spends on projects that may not earn profits for years to come  As shown in Figure 2  GOOGL spends more on research and development than other American company 

Figure 2  GOOGL s R D Spending Dwarfs the Competition



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings

The difference in R D spending between GOOGL and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  in second is larger than the difference between MSFT and IBM  NYSE IBM   the company with the 13th largest R D budget  No company is devoting more resources to innovation and future technologies than GOOGL 

Readers may notice one glaring omission from Figure 2  Amazon does not report its R D spending and instead bundles it into a line item called  Technology and Content   AMZN spent  22 6 billion on technology and content last year  but we know that about  4 5 billion of that went to the content budget  and AWS related costs also make up a substantial portion  It s hard to know just how much AMZN spends on R D  but it s clearly less than GOOGL 

All that R D spending has GOOGL positioned to control key industries in the future  We re just finishing up a series on the growing importance of artificial intelligence  and GOOGL is one of the unquestioned leaders in the field of AI 

GOOGL s AI research is already paying off in numerous ways beyond just improving the core search experience  The company is using its technology to help customers build and train their own machine learning systems  which adds more value to a rapidly growing cloud business  It will also start renting out its AI chips soon for another avenue of monetization 

Self driving cars represent another promising technology  and the company s Waymo division is acknowledged as a leader in the field  The commercial potential for advanced self driving technology is enormous  as GOOGL could license its software to automakers or partner with ride hailing companies to provide an autonomous transportation fleet  GOOGL could even use its technology the same way it does Android  as a way to control the user experience and expand its market share as cars become more interconnected 

Beyond these technologies  the umbrella structure of Alphabet allows the company s subsidiaries to pursue many more speculative projects  such as research into extending the human lifespan  that could end up being enormously valuable if they can make real breakthroughs 

Essentially  GOOGL s dominance in search and video gives it an abundant funding stream to pursue technological breakthroughs while still earning fantastic profits for investors 

Bear Case  Rising Traffic Acquisition Costs and Antitrust Suits

The market has two primary concerns when it comes to GOOGL  The first is the company s rising traffic acquisition costs  TAC   which is the money it pays to third parties to promote its search engine  Most notably  TAC paid to Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  seems to be rising significantly as mobile searches take up a larger share of global search activity  As a result  the company s gross margins have been in decline 

However  Figure 3 shows that the long term trend for TAC and gross margins still looks strong  TAC as a percent of revenue has experienced a momentary spike in prior years and then continued its long term downtrend  At the same time  gross margins have fluctuated  but stayed around 60  

Figure 3  GOOGL s Gross Margins and TAC as a   of Revenue Since 2004



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings

Analysts believe the recent spike in TAC is attributable to a renegotiation of GOOGL s deal with Apple  and CFO Ruth Porat says these costs should stabilize in the coming quarters 

Even if TAC continues to rise and gross margins fall  the company can offset this margin compression with revenue growth and increasing economies of scale  Since 2014  GOOGL s SG A as a percent of revenue has fallen from 21  to 18   This trend should continue as the company continues to grow 

The longer term threat to GOOGL comes in the form of antitrust pressures  The company was fined  2 7 billion by the EU last year for favoring some of its own shopping services over rivals  Investors and analysts worry that regulatory pressure could pose an existential threat to the company s core search business 

While it seems plausible that GOOGL could face more fines in the future  it s hard to imagine regulators posing such a big threat to the company  There s just not the political pressure for regulators to crack down harshly on a free service that is widely admired by consumers  It seems much more likely that GOOGL will face occasional fines for specific actions than it will have its entire business model undermined 

Opportunity to Buy the Dip

After a 10  drop from its peak  GOOGL s share price of  1 070 gives it a price to economic book value  PEBV  of 1 6  which implies that the company s after tax profit  NOPAT  will never grow more than 60  above its current level  By comparison  the Software and IT Services industry as a whole has a PEBV of 2 8  One would think a company with GOOGL s track record would be valued at a premium to its peers  not a discount 

If GOOGL s NOPAT margin expands to 23   based on Cowen s estimate of tax reform s impact  and the company can grow after tax profit by 14  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  1 520 share today  a 41  upside from the current price  Those expectations may seem high  but they pale in comparison to the company s 20  compounded annual NOPAT growth rate over the past decade 

GOOGL is more expensive than the companies we usually recommend  which tend to have a PEBV of 1 2 or below  Still  as Warren Buffett once wrote   It s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price   GOOGL is a wonderful company  and its current price is more than fair 

Tax Reform and Capital Return Provide a Catalyst

In addition to the lower tax rate mentioned above  the new tax law gives GOOGL the opportunity to repatriate some of its  100  billion in excess cash at a lower 15 5  rate  The company already took a  10 2 billion  transitional tax  charge in 2017 to prepare for this repatriation 

Since the company s R D and investments are well funded out of current cash flows  we suspect a large portion of the repatriated cash will go to capital return  The company recently announced an  8 6 billion  1  of market cap  stock buyback program  and it would not be surprising to see that number increase significantly in the near future 

Longer term  the company s steadily growing cash flow should serve to propel the stock higher 

Executive Compensation Should be More Transparent

GOOGL does not specify what metrics it uses to determine executive compensation  instead including a long list of metrics that can be used  The company notes that equity awards are granted on a biennial basis and vest quarterly over a four year period 

We re encouraged by the fact the list of possible metrics includes ROIC  but we d like to see more transparency from GOOGL so that investors can better understand executive incentives  However  GOOGL s current exec comp plan has not led to executives getting paid while destroying shareholder value  The company has generated positive economic earnings in every year since 1998  and has grown economic earnings from  3 1 billion in 2007 to  18 8 billion in 2017 

Insider Trading and Short Interest Trends

Insiders have acquired 235 thousand shares and sold 664 thousand shares over the past twelve months  for a net sale of 429 thousand shares  The total volume of insider trading represents less than 1  of shares outstanding  Minimal insider trading activity gives little insight to the stock 

There are currently 3 2 million shares sold short  which equates to 1  of shares outstanding and two days to cover  The market doesn t seem to have much interest in betting against such a profitable and fast growing company

338873,BFb,Brown Forman  BF B  Q4 Earnings  What Awaits The Stock ,opinion,"Brown Forman Corporation   the leading producer and distributor of premium alcoholic beverages  is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results on June 7 before market opens  Investors are keen to know whether the company will post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  after missing the same in the preceding quarter  In the trailing four quarters  Brown Forman outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2 3  
Brown Forman  NYSE BFb  Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents for the fourth quarter and  1 73 for fiscal 2017 has remained stable over the past 30 days  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  736 4 million for the upcoming release  Let s now have a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors Influencing the Quarter
Brown Forman gains strength from its strong portfolio of premium American whiskey brands  along with its Jack Daniel s trademark  The company expects to grow on the back of strong demand for its authentic American whiskey brands worldwide  consumer interest in flavored whiskey and a growing trend in premium spirits  Its consistent focus on pricing  product innovation and expansion solidify its market position 
However  the company has been battling currency woes for a while now  along with tough economic conditions in emerging markets and soft travel network  These have been hurting its top line which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five of the past seven quarters  Further  the company anticipates these obstacles along with an uncertain geopolitical environment to linger in fiscal 2017 
Management had earlier projected 3 4  growth in underlying sales and earnings per share in the range of  1 71  1 76 
Also a look at Brown Forman s share price movement in the past three month shows that the stock has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  While shares of the company increased 6 7  in the said time frame  the industry registered growth of 8 6  

What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Brown Forman is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Brown Forman has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 40 cents Although  the company has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  we need to have a positive ESP in order to be confident about earnings surprise 
Stocks with Favorable Combination
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
MGP Ingredients  Inc    NASDAQ MGPI   has an Earnings ESP of  2 44  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Cott Corporation   NYSE COT   has an Earnings ESP of  6 67  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Amplify Snack Brands  Inc    NYSE BETR   has an Earnings ESP of  12 50  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research 
It s not the one you think ",2017-05-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/brown-forman-(bf.b)-q4-earnings:-what-awaits-the-stock-200192683,200192683
293968,TSLA,Tesla seen finding ample appetite for its newest convertible bond,news,"By Kate Duguid NEW YORK  Reuters    Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  Inc should find no shortage of demand for the  1 35 billion convertible bond the electric carmaker is selling even though the terms it is offering look inferior on paper to a similar deal two years ago  bond investors said Thursday  And Tesla s volatile and broadly underperforming stock is one reason why  they said  Convertible securities feature the income and protections of a low yielding bond but offer the potential to profit far more from a jump in the stock price that triggers repayment in shares rather than cash   In the new deal  being sold alongside  650 million in new shares  Tesla is looking to offer an interest rate below the coupon on its previous convertible from two years ago  even though interest rates today are broadly higher  There is also a higher bar for taking advantage of the stock price   Investors  however  said the new deal in fact looks appealing when compared with Tesla s existing convertibles  which now feature even leaner yields and  because the stock has been so wobbly  an even lower chance at striking a rich equity conversion before those bonds mature in the next three years   With this new bond  you have five years until the bond is supposed to pay off  They don t have to be successful  they don t have to hit a home run  They just have to stay in business to refinance this in five years   said Geoffrey Dancey  managing partner and portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management   The fundraising   which could top  2 billion in total   is easing Wall Street concerns about the carmaker  which has struggled to maintain profitability  and its ability to overcome a drop in sales and build new product lines  Tesla shares  which had fallen by nearly 10  in the two years since its last convertible was sold  ended more than 4  higher on Thursday  The new convertible bond is seen carrying a coupon of between 1 5  and 2 0  with a conversion premium of between 27 5  and 32 5  over the reference price for Tesla shares at the time of the sale  according to a trader who saw preliminary marketing materials for the deal on Thursday   While those appear to be poorer terms for investors than the 2 375  coupon on the  977 5 million convertible bond maturing in March 2022  it is superior to the current yield to maturity on that 2022 bond at around 1   Dancey said   On its face  the conversion premium being touted  with a midpoint at 30   also compares unfavorably to the 2022 bond s lower conversion premium of 25   But the underperformance of the stock  which closed at  244 10 on Thursday  means holders of the 2022 bond need at least a 34  rise in the stock to a price of 327 50 in order to trigger a conversion   The terms of the convertible look reasonable  and I don t think they ll have any issue selling   said Dancey  who may buy some of the new bonds  He does not have an existing position  Another boost to demand could come from the legion of short sellers of Tesla shares who often buy convertibles as a hedge  a common arbitrage used by hedge funds  said Eli Pars  co chief investment officer at Calamos Investments  More than 25  of Tesla s public float of stock is sold short    I haven t heard anything that would make me think this would have any trouble getting done   Pars said  Calamos has positions in convertibles from both Tesla and its solar panel making unit  Solar City  according to its most recent SEC filing    With convertible bonds there are many opportunities for things to turn out OK   he said   Ross Gerber  chief executive of investment manager Gerber Kawasaki  known for his bullish positions on Tesla said the  noise  surrounding Tesla   including Chief Executive Elon Musk s recent court fight with the SEC over his tweets   had rattled some of his clients

286747,AAPL,Portrait Of An Upcoming Stock Bubble,opinion,"Just like the Dutch Tulip Bulb bubble  internet stock bubble  and the mid 2000 s financial asset bubble  the current stock market is no longer a price discovery mechanism  It has deteriorated into a venue in which Central Bank manufctured liquidity   in the form of printed currency and credit creation   has flooded into the system  enabling investors to chase the few stocks rising in price at the highest velocity  click to enlarge  graph on the left sourced from   

The drivers of this modern day Dutch Tulip phenomenon are the so called  Five Horsemen  stocks   Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB   Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOG  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  
To that grouping I toss in Tesla Inc  NASDAQ TSLA   Among all of those bubble stocks  TSLA has become  by far  the most disconnected from any remote intrinsic  fundamental value  AAPL alone is responsible for 25  of the YTD gain in the Dow and 13  of the YTD gain in the S P 500  AAPL s revenues and operating income have declined over the last three years  2014 to 2016   More often than not  even on days when the S P Dow are red  most if not all of the Five Horsemen   TSLA seem to close green 
Eventually  the music will stop and this  no price discovery possible  market will become a  can t find a seat  market  The abruptness and rate of decline will be breathtaking  Perhaps only matched by the outflow of capital from the cryptos by  investors  who leveraged up their cryptocurrency holdings to throw more  money  at TSLA 
The good news is that a lot of money can be made shorting stocks  Since April  stocks like IBM  NYSE IBM   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Sears  NASDAQ SHLD   Beazer  NYSE BZH and General Electric Company  NYSE GE presented in the Short Seller s Journal as shorts have outperformed the SPX Dow  SHLD is down 47  in 7 weeks   a home run  BZH is down 18  in three weeks  In the next issue  a  funky  financial stock will be featured that has the potential to drop at least 50  over the next 12 months if not sooner 
No one knows what event will trigger the stock bubble collapse  One possibility is the ongoing financial implosion of the State of Illinois  In stock bubble periods  all news is imbued with  the glass is half full   As an example  Illinois  credit rating was reduced recently to BB  Baa3  That is a junk rating  But the media characterizes it as a  the lowest investment grade  rating   i e  the  glass is half full  
Both rating agencies never downgraded Enron to junk until it was weeks from Chapter 7 bankruptcy  Illinois is on the brink of financial disaster  See this article as an example    This problem is absolutely dwarfed by Illinios  public pension problem  which Illinois underfunded by a couple hundred billion  officially about  130 billion but that s not on a true mark to market basis  
When the music finally stops  the perma bubble bulls will be looking for that proverbial  seat  in all the wrong places  But the next stampede of capital will be out of stocks  bonds  cryptos and  investment  homes and into physical gold  silver and mining stocks ",2017-06-08,David I.

It s too early to claim victory  but there may be signs of economic improvement
 in terms of back to school  it s way too early to claim victory  but we do feel good based on the early start     Department Store 
Kohls saw some strength in back to school
 we have started see some strength in our back to school business as we have been through in August      Department Store 
Even an industrial company noted positive progress
 if we look back at the quarter  I think month to month throughout the quarter  we saw modest positive progressions It s early in August  but we would see improvement     Industrial Distributor 
Department store results were weak  but that may be because consumers are spending on other categories
 The overall growth in the economy is modest to best and we are seeing customers gravitating to restaurants  recreational services  healthcare and electronics rather than to traditional general merchandize apparel and furnishing category      Department Store 
Still  restauranteurs  confidence may be slipping in the other direction
 Consumer confidence and the outlook of food service operators are at historically high levels  but have slipped somewhat in the summer months Restaurant spend is up  but traffic is generally flat      Food Distributor 
Quick Service Restaurants are bracing for increases in minimum wages
 the first labor increase will come in December  There s no doubt it can take a toll on the entire industry      QSR 
 It s having a big impact  I will tell you one thing that people are all nervous about it everybody is now  they know it s reality and everybody s trying to figure out a way of redesigning their kitchen      Kitchen Equipment 
Higher medical costs are pressuring companies too
 the pressure of higher medical cost which I think is probably impacting most companies we also expect a big increase in medical expense for the full year as well      Apparel

 The overall economy didn t do us any favors in the first half of the year  We look forward to the effects of the stronger dollar beginning to year around in the fourth quarter     Apparel 
International 
Construction markets are very slow outside of North America
 I think North America  particularly talking about North America  I think we know we can cover the other regions but again I think the main activity in a world right now  construction land is in North America  Europe is doing okay  but I think the relative strength that we are seeing around the world will be primarily in North America      Industrial Equipment 
Adecco  SIX ADEN  sees strength in Europe  especially in manufacturing sectors
 The overall trend in all businesses in Europe has continued to become more positive what you see now  it s again a pickup of this activity  automotive  but also aerospace  retail  And I don t know if we have already mentioned it also in this call the construction sector  which was the biggest segment of this industry in France  went down dramatically and now has stabilized      temp employment 
Nestle saw some growth in China  but was understandably cautious
 if you look at the last three months we were having mid single digit growth in China  which is good  which is satisfactory That being said  I want to be careful  As you saw and as you read and as you heard over the last couple of days  there is a lot of volatility today in China  So we are satisfied with what we have seen that being said  we are very careful about the outlook     Packaged Foods 
China was down 3  for Cisco  which was actually the best performance in eight quarters  Brazil was down 45 
 If we go through the five BRICM countries  Brazil actually was negative 45   Russia was negative 38   China was negative 3   which actually was the best performance we ve had in eight quarters  And we had some bright spots  India was plus 5   Mexico was plus 26   and Mexico had just a tremendous year in general      Internet Infrastructure 
It sounds like Brazil is dealing with a pretty major recession
 I think the short term for Brazil is a bit daunting I think the political environment today is a bit rarified and we just have to live with that  as people worry about their jobs  they go out less  I think people in Brazil today are worried      McDonald s Franchisee 
South American economies may be weaker than in 2009
 we did not see as much weakness in 2009  we did not have the currency devaluation that we have seen right now  which are in some cases up to 30  and 35   So we did not see that in 2009  there was some certainty in 2009 but the economies were still growing  I don t have all the figures on my mind right now  but the economies were still growing and actually 2010  2011 were strong growth years for most of the economies in Latin America      Airline 
The Brazilian government is having to make tough decisions
 I believe that the Brazilian government is doing the right things at this time and taking some very brave decisions  including cutting spending  raising interest rates and that these will have good long term effects  but certainly they re very tough in the short run  but I really commend their bravery     Power Generation 
Elections in Argentina could finally pave the way for a more positive environment in that country
 elections in October  the two leading candidates either one would be favorable  I think you ll have a gradual return to market based pricing and a lifting of the exchange controls It is basically considerably developed country and quite wealthy  So  it s again  I think it s probably on the rebound at this stage      Power Generation

A hiccup in natural foods  Organic and Almond milk growth has slowed 
 organic milk volume growth at retail has decelerated the past five quarters  While the category is still experiencing positive growth  supply issues and retail prices appear to be capping at share of the category like organic milk  the almond milk category has had similar deceleration in growth rates since early 2014  It also appears to us that almond milk maybe on its way to ending this growth cycle much sooner than soy      Dairy 
Does a company with 71 restaurants really need 29 internationally 
 On the international front  during the quarter we opened our second Shack in the U K   located on the Street  in the heart of the bustling Westfield Stratford City shopping centre  as well as our third Shack in Moscow  Russia     QSR 
For the first time ever consumers spent more money eating out than at grocery stores

Was Google s Alphabet announcement a tacit admission that core Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  is plateauing  Larry Page would rather spend his time elsewhere 
 Sergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things      Conglomerate 
It was also probably a signal that the company wont be returning capital to shareholders
 We will rigorously handle capital allocation We also like that it means alpha bet  Alpha is investment return above benchmark   which we strive for      Conglomerate 
As Alphabet diversifies away from data  old media companies like Newscorp are showing up late to the data party

359489,RTN,Consolidations To Lift Aerospace Defense Equipment Stocks,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises firms that manufacture a wide variety of vital components for the aerospace defense space  ranging from aerostructures  space shuttles  propulsion systems  aircraft engines  defense electronics  missile and radar systems to flight test equipment  structural adhesives  instrumentation and control systems  communication products and many more  A few of these companies also offer integrated simulation and training services to the U S  defense force While the majority of revenues is generated from production of the aforementioned accompaniments  the industry players also generate revenues by providing notable aftermarket support and services like maintenance  repair and overhaul activities to defense players  A prominent stock in this industry is Transdigm Group Inc   TDG  Here are the three major industry themes While rising competition has frequently prompted industry majors to expand their product lines through small and medium sized acquisitions  lately  there have been some big mergers in the industry  These can be attributed to the growing importance of cost reduction initiatives and increased control over production procedures  Speaking of such mergers  aerospace parts makers and suppliers  Hexcel Corporation  HXL  and Woodward entered into an all stock merger of equals agreement in January  The deal  worth  6 4 billion  will give birth to one of the top independent aerospace and defense suppliers globally  Such consolidations by leading industry players should improve economies of scale for the aerospace defense equipment industry as a whole   Being the largest digitally advanced nation  the United States is rapidly enhancing its electronic warfare  C4ISR  Command  Control  Communication  Computers  Intelligence  Surveillance and Reconnaissance  and cyber security measures  following frequent cyber attacks that affected a number of countries last year  According to Markets and Markets firm  the global C4ISR market is expected to witness CAGR of 3 6  from 2017 to 2022 to reach  119 4 billion  with North America dominating the market  This should further boost prospects of the stocks in this space  especially those providing defense electronics  U S  labor market statistics apparently reflect strong growth trends with the nation s unemployment rate reaching a 50 year low of 3 5  in September 2019  However  a deeper analysis shows that all is not well  The majors low labor force participation rate  which means fewer people are finding a place in the labor force   either because they lack the skills to enter it or are falling out of it  Now  the U S aerospace defense equipment industry  which employed more than 2 5 million workers as of the end of 2018  needs highly skilled labor  Unfortunately  U S  population growth rate has been decelerating since 1992  So  the working age population is not growing fast enough to meet the demand  To this end  a skills gap  from Deloitte and National Association of Manufacturers projected in 2018 that more than half of the 4 6 million manufacturing jobs created throughout the next decade will go unfilled  This remains a concern for growth of the aerospace defense equipment industry Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Gloomy OutlookThe Zacks Aerospace Defense Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  186  which places it in the bottom 27  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is due to a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts have lost confidence in this group s earnings growth potential in recent times  Evidently  the industry s earnings estimates for the current fiscal year have gone down by 1 7  since Dec 31 Before we present a few aerospace defense equipment stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Outperforms S P 500 and SectorThe Aerospace Defense Equipment industry has outperformed the Zacks S P 500 composite as well as its own sector over the past year  The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 45 8   while the Aerospace sector has gained 26 9   However  the Zacks S P 500 composite has rallied 27 6  in the same

Department of Defense  DoD   along with accelerating commercial aircraft production on account of rapidly rising global air traffic  should keep U S  Aerospace Defense Equipment stocks  momentum alive

245524,ALGT,Allegiant Travel  An Amazing Airline Stock,opinion,The airline industry has been notoriously tricky investing terrain  For one  airlines are victims to volatile jet fuel costs  which have constantly plagued major airlines as United Airlines  NYSE  UAL  and Southwest Airlines  NYSE  LUV  until recently  when jet fuel prices have started to decline  Moreover  low customer satisfaction due to such problems as flight delay  lost baggage  and additional costs has been a thorn in the side for several companies such as U S  Airways  NYSE  LCC  and Delta Airlines  NYSE  DAL   The consistently worst offender in customer satisfaction is ultra low cost carrier Spirit Airlines  NASDAQ  SAVE   which leads the airline industry in piling additional costs on the consumer  it currently  carry on fee The industry is also saturated with competitors that offer hardly differentiated products  making it hard for specific companies to carve out niches in the airline industry  Moreover  the industry has also historically had problems with labor unions  for example  Spirit Airlines was the focus of a major pilot strike and approximately 50  of its workforce in 2011 was composed of union members     Even Warren Buffett notably stated in his  that the airline industry was  the worst sort of business   lamenting that the lack of a durable competitive advantage among the airline companies makes the industry  gruesome   With his signature wittiness  Buffett observed   Indeed  if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk  he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down     However  despite the hostile investing environment of the airline industry  one airline company continues to soar and prosper  Allegiant Travel Company  NASDAQ  ALGT   This moderately large airline  with a market cap of around  1 33B  focuses on providing low cost airfare  The company has already seen its stock increase 31 4  YTD and is barely 1 3  off its 52 week high  indicating strong market demand for the stock  The strength of its stock shows that Allegiant is benefiting from several advantages unique to itself but also from broader economic conditions One of the main advantages of Allegiant s business model is that it doesn t try to do everything and accommodate every passenger  a business strategy bigger airlines such as Delta have adopted  Although this strategy does provide more opportunities to generate revenue  it also comes with a risk of overextending and decreasing profit margins  Instead  Allegiant s strategy is to accommodate leisure travelers in small cities that bigger airlines wouldn t want to touch  Allegiant caters to hundreds of these small cities across the United States through direct flights from these cities to major cities tourist destinations such as Las Vegas  Orlando  and Los Angeles  Despite intense overall competition in the airline industry  Allegiant experiences little to no competition on its flight routes and incredibly  has established a niche in the airline industry Allegiant has the ability to implement a variable flight schedule since its customer base is relatively small and the traveling seasons of its customers are roughly predictable  Depending on demand  Allegiant has the flexibility to add or cut flight routes and even postpone flight times in times of low demand  This flexibility  which is unheard of in the larger airlines  has allowed Allegiant to adapt to rough times in the airline industry and has enhanced its durability as a company  For example  when oil prices skyrocketed in 2007 and most of the airline industry teetered near the brink of collapse  Allegiant was able to turn a profit by simply cutting half of its average daily scheduled flights in just two months  Allegiant has mastered the ability to use its flight schedule flexibility to mitigate losses during times of economic hardship and increase profit in times of economic prosperity  an ability which no other major airline has been able to utilize effectively On top of these unique strategic advantages  Allegiant recently implemented a potentially significant revenue generator in the form of introducing a  35 carry on bag fee  This fee will add additional revenue to what is already an extremely impressive balance sheet  For one  Allegiant  first quarter 2012 EPS of  1 12  which beat estimates by  0 13  and revenue of  237 9M  which beat by  2M and represents a 23  YOY increase  Moreover  this is Allegiant s 37th consecutive profitable quarter  which is proof of a capable management team that has steered the company through economic and company hardships  For the entire year  Allegiant is expected to report a 60 31  YOY increase in earnings  It should also be noted that Allegiant has a completely manageable Debt Equity Ratio of 39      Finally  Allegiant  as well as all of the aforementioned airline companies  will benefit from the recent decreases in jet fuel prices  Fuel is the single largest expense for airlines and accounts for nearly one third of the industry s operating expenses  However  jet fuel prices  more than a 12  tumble in prices  from a February peak of  3 29 a gallon to  2 72 on June 23  To put that into perspective  a savings of 40 cents a gallon amounts to an annualized   5 5 billion windfall for the industry   according to J P  Morgan analyst Jamie Baker  The decline in jet fuel prices will definitely contribute positively to Allegiant s bottom line    Overall  Allegiant is one of the best airlines in the industry  Due to its catering to a specific niche of air travel  smart business strategies  excellent financials  and improving conditions for the airline industry  Allegiant definitely has significant upside potential in the future ,2012-06-24,George Liu,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allegiant-travel:-an-amazing-airline-stock-127450,127450

316580,PG,Carrefour  Tesco deal to squeeze suppliers  big and small,news,"By Dominique Vidalon and James Davey PARIS LONDON  Reuters    A deal between  Carrefour   PA CARR  and  Tesco   L TSCO  to team up on global purchasing will help them not only cut prices but also expand their own label ranges  tightening a squeeze on major brand producers such as Nestle and Kraft Heinz  The Carrefour Tesco alliance will reset relationships with global suppliers like  Unilever   L ULVR   Nestle  S NESN  and Procter   Gamble  N PG   at a time when they are already battling sluggish demand and start up rivals  In a further blow to major consumer goods firms  the pair will also jointly source own brand products  sales of which are growing rapidly in Europe due to the expansion of discounters like Aldi and Lidl which mostly stock private label goods   Buying alliances have a detrimental effect on the whole food supply chain   said Mella Frewen  director general of FoodDrinkEurope  an industry lobby group  However  the alliance could also allow smaller suppliers that only supply one of the retailers to double their business   They could be into a massive opportunity for which they might very well drop their prices and compete   said David Sables  CEO of Sentinel Management Consultants  which coaches suppliers on how to negotiate with big supermarket groups  Sales growth at Nestle  Procter   Gamble and Unilever has been driven almost entirely by shifting more goods this year  rather than price rises given a tough retail environment  In the latest salvo from an activist investor seeking to shake up the sector  Third Point on Sunday recommended a series of steps to boost earnings at Nestle  whose brands include KitKat chocolates and Thomy sauces  Faced with consumers shifting towards healthier food and independent brands  manufacturers like Nestle are responding by trying to sell more premium  higher priced items  But retailers are reluctant to put up prices as they face their own battle with discount groups and online players like internet giant Amazon  O AMZN    Top brands have long taken a hard line in negotiations with retailers  assuming that stores are loathe to remove consumers  favourite products from their shelves   That approach backfired for Nestle earlier this year when a buying group representing six European retailers flexed its muscles with the Swiss group  pulling some of its products for months during a pricing row that was only settled in May  The Carrefour Tesco alliance is just the latest purchasing agreement struck by major European retailers in recent years  German retailer Metro  DE B4B  agreed a similar partnership with Auchan  Casino and Schiever of France last week  The deals compound pressure on suppliers after Britain s second ranked Sainsbury s  L SBRY  agreed to buy Wal Mart owned  N WMT  Asda  the number three player  PRIVATE LABEL SALES RISING FAST Tesco CEO Dave Lewis  a former Unilever executive  said branded giants were being outflanked by start ups and retailers when it comes to developing new products   For a lot of branded manufacturers     agility is not always there and so they are getting out innovated by a lot of small players   Lewis said last week  While about half of Tesco s sales already comes from private label goods  which tend to be more profitable for retailers than branded ones  the figure is only about a quarter at Carrefour  The French firm aims to raise that to a third by 2022  while it is expected to cut the branded goods it offers by 20 percent  Retailers creating their own products is seen as a major challenge by a quarter of top executives at consumer goods firms  according to a recent survey by consultants KPMG  Private label goods grew to account for more than 31 percent of sales in the European Union in 2016  and are set to keep growing  according to Nielsen  eroding demand for big brands  As Lewis has sought to rebuild trust in the British retailer since an accounting scandal in 2014  Tesco has operated in a more collaborative way with suppliers  in contrast to a confrontational approach at Carrefour  Sables said   Suppliers to Carrefour might think if any of Tesco s attitude in dealing with suppliers rubs off on Carrefour   that s a positive thing   he said  adding Tesco could recommend its private label suppliers to Carrefour and vice versa  The alliance could impact companies like Biscuit International  a leading producer of own label sweet biscuits owned by private equity firm Qualium Investissement  according to Yves Marin  an associate at Bartle Business Consulting  The deal could take time to take effect as private label contracts run for one to two years and suppliers will have to cross check prices of products sold by Tesco and Carrefour  Marin added  POWER SHIFT  In another sign of the shifting balance of power towards retailers  British supermarkets are taking longer to pay their suppliers  according to Duncan Swift  who runs the food advisory group at business consultancy Moore Stephens   The swelling  piggy bank  of supplier monies held by supermarkets exacerbates the risk of them making unwarranted deductions which causes suppliers financial distress   he said  Swift said retailers had to be careful about how they implement purchasing alliances so they do not ring alarm bells with competition authorities  adding they do this by not sharing too much information  Ian Wright  chief executive of Britain s Food and Drink Federation  said the Tesco Carrefour deal would increase concerns about buyer power stoked by the Sainsbury Asda merger and the risks they impose on suppliers  mostly smaller firms   It is imperative that these important changes to retailer supplier market dynamics are properly examined by the competition authorities   in the round   he said   Britain s Competition and Markets Authorities is already examining the merger of  Sainsbury  and Asda  which are expected to argue their deal is justified given the shake up of the market due to the rise of the discounters and Amazon  Discounters now account for 22 percent of sales of fast moving consumer goods in Europe  up from 17 percent a decade ago  according to data analytics firm Nielsen  Analysts at Fitch Ratings do not expect the Tesco Carrefour partnership to be subject to competition scrutiny as they have hardly any geographic overlap  although regulators could start paying more attention if more alliances emerge  David McCarthy  HSBC head of consumer retail research  said buying alliances have not worked well in the past as retailers have failed to secure standardised prices  But he said Tesco and Carrefour now have a strong incentive to succeed  
 New ways of doing business are needed to deal with exogenous threats such as Amazon and discounter expansion   he said   What is different this time is both the desire and need for the deal to work  ",2018-07-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/carrefour-tesco-deal-to-squeeze-suppliers-big-and-small-1516929,1516929

302609,BA,3 Dividend Paying Transports To Brave Trade   Other Woes,opinion,Crude oil prices jumped 15  to  62 90 per barrel on Sep 16  the biggest one day gain since December 2008   following drone attacks on crude oil facilities in Saudi Arabia  which knocked out about a half of the kingdom s daily crude production  However  Saudi Arabia quickly restored 50  of crude production losses and oil prices started retreating from the historic gains of Sep 16 This apart  the ongoing trade tensions with China  sluggish freight scenario in the United States and other geopolitical issues also give rise to fears of an economic slowdown Transports Not ImmuneGiven this widespread uncertainty  it is natural that the widely diversified transportation sector  which includes airlines  railroads  shippers and leasing companies to name a few  would also be feeling the pinch For example  sluggish freight shipments do not bode well for most players in the space  In fact  according to the latest   North American freight shipments declined for nine consecutive months starting December 2018  What is more concerning is that the sluggish freight environment is expected to persist through this year as predicted by the biggest freight broker in North America  C H  Robinson Worldwide   NASDAQ CHRW    while releasing its second quarter 2019 results Slowdown in global trade due to Sino U S  trade tensions is a major headwind for companies in the space as it is hurting demand  As evidence  railroad operator  Union Pacific   NYSE UNP   trimmed its volume growth outlook for the second half of the year blaming the trade spat Additionally  third party logistics provider  Expeditors International of Washington   NASDAQ EXPD    which has significant exposure to China  witnessed a decline of almost 5  in its revenues from North Asia in the first six months of 2019  In fact  revenues from Expeditors  primary unit  Airfreight Services  declined 5  in the first half of 2019  Moreover  the prolonged grounding of Boeing  NYSE BA  737 MAX jets is hurting airline operators with such jets in their fleet due to increased losses from multiple flight cancellations Moreover  the steady decline in utility coal shipments in the United States is hurting railroads  top lines  This is because fortunes of railroad operators are tied to coal as revenues from the commodity contribute significantly to top line  According to the Association of American Railroads  coal rail traffic this year is down 6 6  through Sep 14 Sector Lags on Price FrontThe turbulence in the space can be gauged from the fact that the

333801,STZ,Billionaire Nelson Peltz Joins Aurora Cannabis as Strategic Adviser,news," Bloomberg     Billionaire investor Nelson Peltz is joining Aurora Cannabis Inc  as a strategic adviser and is receiving stock options that could make him the pot firm s second largest shareholder 
Peltz  whose New York based Trian Fund Management LP has more than  10 billion under management  will advise Aurora on  potential partnerships with leading corporations   the company said in a statement Wednesday  Aurora s shares jumped more than 7 percent in early trading in New York  reaching as high as  8 60 each 
 Nelson is a globally recognized business visionary with a strong track record of constructive engagement to generate accelerated  profitable growth and shareholder value across many verticals of great interest to us   Aurora Chief Executive Officer Terry Booth said in the statement 
Peltz has been granted 20 million options to purchase Aurora shares at C 10 34 each  slightly below Tuesday s closing price of  10 64 in Toronto  They will vest on a quarterly basis over four years  or faster if certain conditions are met  If exercised in full  that would make Peltz Aurora s second largest shareholder after ETF provider Vanguard Group Inc   according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
 I believe Aurora has a solid execution track record  is strongly differentiated from its peers  has achieved integration throughout the value chain and is poised to go to the next level   Peltz said in the statement   I look forward to helping Terry and the extended Aurora team evaluate its many operational and strategic opportunities  including potential engagement with mature players in consumer and other market segments  
Aurora  based in Edmonton  Alberta  hasn t yet secured a major strategic partner along the lines of Constellation Brands Inc  NYSE STZ   s investment in Canopy Growth Corp  or  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc  s deal with Cronos Group Inc  Constellation and Altria both have the option of taking majority control of the Canadian cannabis companies in the future 
While the cannabis industry has attracted plenty of high profile names    including Martha Stewart  who recently took an advisory role at Canopy  and Kiss singer Gene Simmons  who s chief evangelist officer at Invictus MD Strategies Corp     Peltz is arguably the highest profile investor to take a job at a pot firm 
Peltz has a long history of agitating for changes in the consumer space  including at Wendy s Co   where he is chairman  Trian has also pushed for changes at major U S  corporations  including Procter   Gamble Co   where he sits on the board  PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  Inc    Mondelez International Inc   NASDAQ MDLZ    and Family Dollar Stores Inc 
Trian  which Peltz co founded in 2005  shuns the term activist investor  preferring to be known as a  highly engaged share owner

297186,MSFT,Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights  JPMorgan  Wells Fargo And Citigroup  ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 9  2020   Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says   A positive Finance sector   7 5  earnings growth on  6 3  revenue growth  is a big help to the aggregate growth picture for the index  Excluding Finance  total Q4 earnings for the rest of the S P 500 index would be down 6 3   Q4 Earnings Season Gets UnderwayNote  The following is an excerpt from this week s  report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  Here are the key points We did not see much earnings growth in the first three quarters of the year  primarily reflecting tough comparisons to last year  and this trend is expected to continue in the last quarter of the year as well Total earnings or aggregate net income for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  3 7  in Q4 from the same period last year on  3 4  higher revenues  with the Energy sector as a big drag on growth Energy sector earnings are expected to be down  42 1  from the same period last year on  4 6  lower revenues  Excluding the Energy sector  total earnings for the index would be down only  1  Sectors with weak growth in Q4  besides Energy  include Autos   56 5    Basic Materials   23 1    Aerospace   18 5    Industrial Products   5 0    Retails   6 8    Tech   4 4    and Transportation   4 8    Q4 earnings are expected to be below the year earlier level for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors  Sectors with positive earnings growth in Q4 include Utilities   17 9    Business Services   9 6    Finance   7 5    and Medical   3 5   Positive Finance sector   7 5  earnings growth on  6 3  revenue growth  is a big help to the aggregate growth picture for the index  Excluding Finance  total Q4 earnings for the rest of the S P 500 index would be down  6 3  The Finance sector s favorable growth picture in Q4 is solely because of easy comparisons in the insurance industry  with earnings for the industry expected to be up  36 4   Excluding the Insurance industry  the Finance sector s Q4 earnings growth drops to  7 6    7 5  with Insurance   Estimates for Q4 have come down since the quarter got underway  with the current  3 7  decline down from  1 1  at the start of October  This magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other recent periods We have seen Q4 results from 19 S P 500 members already  these companies have fiscal quarters ending in November   Total earnings for these 19 index members that have reported already are down  19 1  from the year earlier level on  2 5  higher revenues  with 78 9  beating EPS estimates and 68 4  beating revenue estimates While Q4 earnings growth is below what we have seen for this group of 19 companies in other recent periods  revenue growth was only modestly below what this same group achieved in the preceding period  The proportion of these companies beating EPS and revenue estimates was within the historical range  though revenue beats were on the lower side For the small cap S P 600 index  total Q4 earnings are expected to be down  3 7  from the same period last year on  0 7  higher revenues  with strong growth in the Finance sector helping offset the Energy sector drag Excluding the Finance sector  S P 600 earnings would be down  22 3  in Q4  But had it not been for the Energy sector drag  Q4 earnings would be down only  1 9   Total 2019 earnings or aggregate net income for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  1 7  on  2 7  higher revenues  which would follow the  23 2  earnings growth on  9 2  higher revenues in 2018  Growth is expected to resume in 2020  with earnings growth of  7 9  on  4 0  higher revenues The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2019 P E of 20 4X and index close  as of January 7th  is  159 04  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  171 68 for 2020  P E of 18 9X   The multiples for 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year Worries about the duration of the current economic cycle are not reflected in consensus earnings estimates for next year and beyond  with the 2019 growth challenge primarily a function of tough comparisons to last year s tax cut driven record earnings Finance Sector in Focus Banks will be in the spotlight in the coming days as JPMorgan   NYSE JPM    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   and Citigroup   NYSE C   kick off the Q4 earnings season for the Finance sector  Bank earnings were essentially flat in the first three quarters of 2019 and the Q4 numbers are unlikely be different in any meaningful way Expectations ahead of these results show an earnings decline of  9 8  for the Major Banks industry  which would follow the  0 6  decline in the preceding period  The Major Banks industry  which includes JPMorgan  Citi and Wells Fargo  accounts for almost 45  of the Finance sector s total earnings Unlike the Major Banks industry  the growth picture for the broader Finance sector as a whole is reasonably good  with total Finance sector earnings in Q4 expected be up  7 5  from the same period last year on  6 3  higher revenues Driving the Finance sector s positive growth pace is the Insurance industry  which is benefiting from easy comparisons to the year earlier period  Had it not been for the expected  36 2  earnings growth for the Insurance industry  total Finance sector earnings would actually be down  7 6   the insurance industry brings in almost a quarter of the total Finance sector earnings     Expectations for the QuarterThe earnings growth trend established in the first three quarters of the year is not expected to change in the last quarter of the year  with tough comparisons to the year earlier period weighing on growth For Q4  total earnings for the S P 500 index are currently expected to be down  3 7  on  3 4  higher revenues  with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have lower earnings relative to the year earlier period As has been the trend in other recent periods  Q4 estimates came down as the quarter got underway The magnitude of negative revisions to Q4 estimates is in line with historical trends  In fact  a big reason for the market s favorable reaction to Q3 results was the absence of across the board negative guidance that many in the market appeared to fear ahead of the start of that earnings season Driving this fear was the negative impact of the trade issue on business confidence and growing signs of economic weakness in key regions of the world  including the domestic factory space Earnings growth was essentially flat in the first two quarters of the year  fell  1 7  in Q3  and is expected to be down  3 7  in Q4  This is expected to change as turn the page on 2019 given the tough comparisons to tax boosted earnings in 2018  with growth resuming in 2020 Q1  as the above chart shows  The market appears to have accepted the deceleration in growth this year in the hope that growth resumes from next year onwards The key issue will be if expectations for next year remain stable or start coming down as we move through the remainder of the year  Analysts have not made any significant revisions to their estimates in response to the ongoing trade dispute  likely in the hope that the issue will eventually get resolved  This  coupled with the ongoing economic weakness in Europe  China and elsewhere likely represent downside risks to the growth outlook

245923,LAMR,4 REIT Stocks To Add As U S  Treasury Yields Remain Volatile,opinion,"High flying growth stocks in the recent past no doubt grabbed attention with the stock market witnessing an impressive run  But things of late went haywire as the Federal Reserve deviated from its stance of aggressively hiking the interest rates and rather adopted a more dovish stand  indicating at the recent FOMC meeting that it was unlikely to increase the rates at all in 2019 Consequently  investors  sentiment took a hit as concerns are raised over the fate of the U S  economy amid the ongoing trade war  the economic slowdown in Europe and China and the declining stimulus from the lower tax rates  Further adding to the woes is the cut in GDP growth and the inflation projections by the central bank  Fed s statement read   recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter    Obviously  recessionary fears are brewing up in the market  compelling investors to look for safer havens  particularly toward the security of the government bonds  Demand for long term bonds surged of late and the yield on the 10 year Treasury note went below the yield on the 3 month Treasury bill  resulting in an inversion of the yield curve All these brought back the interest sensitive REITs to the limelight  This is because these are often treated as bond substitutes for the high dividend paying nature  Particularly  government regulations mandate the REITs to disburse at least 90  of their taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders each year Moreover  the underlying fundamentals of several asset categories in the REIT sector exhibit strength  The occupancy levels of properties are hovering near the record high marks  indicating strong demand and the scope for generating steady revenues Therefore  backtracking to the REITs and scouting for stocks with better fundamentals and dividend seem an apt choice  We have handpicked stocks based on a favorable Zacks Rank  high dividend yield and other relevant metrics Plymouth Industrial REIT  Inc    NYSE PLYM   focuses on the acquisition and management of the single and multi tenant industrial properties  The company targets properties in the secondary and select primary markets across the United States and is based in Boston  MA This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock has a dividend yield of nearly 9   Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year funds from operations  FFO  per share has witnessed a 59 9  upward revision over the past 30 days to  2 59  reflecting analysts  optimism on the stock Based in Newton  MA  Industrial Logistics Properties Trust   NASDAQ ILPT   is focused on the ownership and leasing of the industrial and logistics properties  primarily in the United States  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  player s expected FFO per share growth for the current year is 7 4   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year FFO per share has moved nearly 1 8  north over the past 30 days  The stock has a dividend yield of 6 6  Headquartered in Tysons  VA  Park Hotels   Resorts Inc    NYSE PK   is a lodging REIT with premium branded hotels and resorts  majority of which are situated in the key United States markets with high barriers to entry  The stock with a Zacks Rank of 2 has a forward dividend yield of 5 8   Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year FFO per share has been revised nearly 1 3  upward over the past 30 days Lamar Advertising Company   NASDAQ LAMR   is one of the largest outdoor advertising companies in North America  It offers advertisers a variety of billboard  interstate logo and transit advertising formats  helping both the local businesses as well as the national brands reach out to broader audiences every day  This Zacks  2 Ranked company s expected FFO per share growth for the current year is 6 0   The stock has a forward dividend yield of around 5 0

376990,AMZN,Is Rush Enterprise  RUSHA  A Good Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Rush Enterprise  Inc    NASDAQ RUSHA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Rush Enterprise has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 89  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 71  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Rush Enterprise s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 14 93 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 25 58  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Rush Enterprise has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 32  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Rush Enterprise stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Rush Enterprise has a P S ratio of about 0 25  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 34x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Rush Enterprise currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Rush Enterprise a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Rush Enterprise is just 0 62  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 67  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  RUSHA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Rush Enterprise might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of F  This gives RUSHA a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been robust at best  The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen none up and down in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 0 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 2 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Rush Enterprises  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat bullish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineRush Enterprise is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 1  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Whole Sales industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to delve deeper in this stock as it appears to be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2019-08-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-rush-enterprise-rusha-a-good-pick-for-value-investors-200453626,200453626

Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  delivering average positive surprise of a whopping 195  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered adjusted earnings of 4 cents per share

the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  257 million We believe diversified expanding merchant base will drive top line growth in the to be reported quarter  The company continues to launch a number of merchant friendly applications to meet the requirements of a dynamic retail environment  in turn bolstering merchant base  Notably  shares of Shopify have gained 40 8  in the past year  against the  s

 indicating year over year growth of 40  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors Likely to Influence Q4 ResultsShopify is leaving no stone unturned to expand business by making its platform as merchant friendly as possible  We believe that the company s easy to use upgrades and expanding merchant base are likely to boost Gross Merchandise Volume   GMV    soaring 55  from the year ago quarter to  10 billion in the last reported quarter  This trend is anticipated to continue  thereby aiding the company to perform impressively We expect the momentum witnessed by Shopify Payments  Shopify Plus  Shopify Capital and Shopify Shipping to continue in the to be reported quarter as well  Further  the launch of Shopify Ping in the recent past is anticipated to boost top line growth Notably  in the quarter under review  Shopify announced the acquisition of TicTail  a Swedish e commerce company  per a report by Financial Post  However  the financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps This move is a clear indication of Shopify s strategy of increasing initiatives to penetrate international markets  which is a positive  We believe the buyout will enable the company to bolster growth prospects and improve competitive position against the likes of Wix   NASDAQ WIX    and other peers Further  Shopify recently opened its first brick and mortar store in Los Angeles  CA  The store is staffed with a panel of experts dubbed as the  Gurus  to guide both the existing and prospective merchants through its robust product and services portfolio We believe it is a smart move to time the inauguration with holiday season and is anticipated to aid the company capitalize on the purchasing furor of consumers  Notably  more than 400 Shopify merchants based out of Los Angeles have each individually garnered GMV of more than  1 million  Notably  there are approximately 10 000 Shopify merchants teeming the city The company has been developing various apps  including varied augmented reality   AR   and virtual reality   VR   based applications  in order to streamline customer experience  We believe that the company will reap benefits from investments in latest technological developments Shopify s expanding partner ecosystem is aiding it to identify and reach out to merchants who were otherwise inaccessible  Notably  in the third quarter  more than 16 500 partners had referred merchants to Shopify over the past 12 months Moreover  sales channels like Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Pay  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Messenger  Instagram  Pinterest  eBay   NASDAQ EBAY   and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  continue to attract new merchants  The availability of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Pay  Google Pay and the addition of Canada Post as sales channels are expected to have a significant impact on its top line in the to be reported quarter Nonetheless  increasing investments on product development  infrastructure and platform are likely to limit

Though Zions Bancorporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of B  This gives ZION a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to five higher  while current year estimate has seen nine upward and three downward revision in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus has dipped 0 9  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has climbed 1 4   in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below  Zions Bancorporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineZions Bancorporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 21  out of more than 250 industries  and Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiments and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation Be among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices  In the process  it s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3 trillion in activity A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech  Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  in the 1990s  Zacks  just released special report reveals 8 stocks to watch  The report is only available for a limited time ",2019-11-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-value-investors-pick-zions-bancorporation-zion-stock-200486342,200486342
359305,GOOGL,Facebook shares dip from high as investors fret over costs  future profit,news,"By Rishika Sadam and David Ingram  Reuters     Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB  reported surging quarterly profit and revenue on Wednesday  helped by its fast growing mobile ad business  but its shares dipped from a record high in after hours trading as investors showed some nervousness about future earnings   The world s biggest online social network  which is nearing the five year anniversary of its initial public offering  is searching for new types of advertising features to supplement its main revenue streams that it expects to cool off this year  Facebook s shares fell 2 4 percent in after hours trading to  148 12  They had closed at an all time high of  153 60 on Tuesday   Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said on a conference call after the company s earnings announcement that ad revenue growth is expected to come down significantly over the rest of 2017  repeating prior company warnings that it is hitting a limit in  ad load   or the number of ads it can squeeze onto users  pages before upsetting them   Wehner gave similar warnings about ad load in November and in February  although a slowdown has not materialized   New products  such as ads that play in the middle of videos or appear on Facebook s Messenger app  could fuel growth  but Wehner and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday those plans were still in early stages   At the same time  the company said expenses would continue at a high level  growing 40 percent to 50 percent this year over 2016 levels and putting a squeeze on future profits   As we look into 2017 and beyond  there are going to be a number of initiatives we believe are valuable to the community and to the company in the long term that are going to be net negative on our operating margin   Wehner said   Facebook s spending contributed to the drop in share price after hours  said Josh Olson  an Edward Jones analyst    Investors were hoping for some indication that we would see some relief as the year progressed  and we still could  I think that expense guidance range  left unchanged  is probably what is weighing on shares   Olson said   GAAP SURPRISE  Facebook said quarterly profit in the first three months of 2017 rose 76 6 percent year over year to  3 06 billion and total revenue went up 49 percent to  8 03 billion   The company caused brief confusion on Wall Street by only issuing numbers conforming to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  GAAP  without warning  Previously it also issued non GAAP numbers  which it had said provided greater transparency and were closely watched by investors and analysts   The company is expected to generate  31 94 billion in mobile ad revenue globally in 2017  up 42 1 percent from a year earlier  according to research firm eMarketer  That would give Facebook a 22 6 percent share of the worldwide mobile ad market  with archrival Google of Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc projected to be the leader with a 35 1 percent share  according to eMarketer  Facebook continued its march toward the 2 billion user threshold  saying it had some 1 94 billion people using its service monthly as of March 31  That was up 17 percent from a year earlier  Analysts on average had expected monthly active users of 1 91 billion  according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet   Net income attributable to Facebook shareholders rose to  3 06 billion  or  1 04 per share  in the first quarter from  1 73 billion  or 60 cents per share  a year earlier  Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 85 percent of the company s total advertising revenue of  7 86 billion in the first quarter ended March 31  compared with about 82 percent a year earlier  Analysts on average had expected total ad revenue of  7 68 billion  according to FactSet

373323,AMZN,Australian retailers brace for worst Christmas since 2013   survey,news,"SYDNEY  Reuters    Sentiment among Australian retailers has slumped to its lowest in six years  with a fifth fewer forecasting a pick up in sales in the Christmas period than a year earlier  a survey of retail executives showed on Wednesday 
Just 62  of retailers expected to grow sales in the holiday gift giving season that runs through December  down from 80  a year earlier and the weakest result since 2013  the survey published by market researcher Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd said 
The reading suggests a series of economic jumpstarts has failed to ignite Australia s retail sector amid competition from cheaper global online entrants like Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  and soft consumer spending due to wage stagnation and a property downturn 
In July  a federal government income tax cut took effect  while the Reserve Bank of Australia sought to encourage spending with three interest rate cuts in June  July and October to a record low of 0 75 per cent 
 Sales volumes are down and as yet the benefits of the federal goverment s tax cuts have not had the stimulus that retailers were hoping for   Deloitte said in a report on the survey of 54 retail executives 
 Interest rates continue to fall  and these have not yet resulted in an improvement in overall sales   the report added 
Retail volumes have fallen in three of the past four quarters to be down 0 2  from a year ago  according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data  the weakest annual volumes since the early 1990s recession 
Just 40  of respondents in the Deloitte survey said they expected to grow their profit margin in the Christmas period  and about the same amount planned to discount store prices  In 2012  just 19  of retailers planned to discount in December  Deloitte added 
Nearly half of respondents reported flat or negative sales growth in the past year  and the percentage of retailers forecasing a pick up in sales in calendar 2020 fell to 72  from 90  a year earlier 
 Australian retailers will be waiting for a recovery in wage and jobs growth to provide a boost where interest rates and government tax cuts fail to provide the stimulus needed   said David White  national leader of Deloitte s Retail  Wholesale and Distribution Group  in a statement ",2019-11-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/australian-retailers-brace-for-worst-christmas-since-2013--survey-2018733,2018733

293645,TSLA,Week Ahead  U S  Equity Sell Off Could Continue  Dollar  Oil To Follow,opinion,"Despite trade progress pessimism drives investors
Utilities post record close  signaling risk aversion
Yields  dollar drop
For a second week  all major US indices fell  closing at their lowest levels in at least nine months  As of Friday  the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 10  below its October peak 
Stocks sold off violently to finish the trading week  with the S P 500  NASDAQ Composite and Russell 2000 joining the mega cap Dow to all end in the red  With the Dow s negative Friday finish  all four major US indices are now officially in correction territory 
Despite reports of trade progress and robust holiday spending  pessimistic investors focused instead on the perceived challenges of the upcoming year  following the almost across the board soft guidance meted out by companies during the just ended earnings season and a slowing global economy 
Positive Fundamentals Developments  Pessimistic Investors
Positive trade developments included  signals that China would become more welcoming to companies based abroad  indications that the country will also resume buying US agricultural products including soybeans  and an announcement by the Chinese government that it would temporarily suspend retaliatory tariff hikes on US cars and auto parts  returning levies to July levels  Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  and BMW  OTC BMWYY  immediately priced in the lower tariffs  cutting prices in China as way of bolstering falling local sales in the world s largest auto market 
However  based on November Industrial Production information released late last week  China s economy slowed more than expected in November  with slower growth in retail sales as well including auto sales set for its first yearly loss since 1990 
On the other hand  US economic data was encouraging  Retail sales grew faster than expected  supported by strong consumer confidence  rising wages and low unemployment  

The S P 500 tumbled 1 91 percent on Friday  pressured by Health Care   3 37   and Technology   2 45   shares  to close at the lowest level for the benchmark since March 29  On a weekly basis  the index slipped 1 26   for a second week and a total of 5 83  
Technically  the SPX may have completed a H S top reversal  Just beware of a bear trap  as its downside breakout was less than 2  though a weekend negative closing demonstrates bearish commitment  In addition  the price struggled at the 100 WMA  Since its September record peak  the S P 500 has fallen 11 25  thus far 
The Dow plunged almost 500 points on Friday  for a 2 02  loss  The 30 component index was dragged down by shares of Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   which plunged 10 04 percent   erasing  38 billion of market value  its sharpest daily selloff since 2002  Investors dumped the stock after a Reuters report was published  alleging the company knew there were traces of asbestos in its baby powder as early as 1971 
Analysts at JPMorgan say that while the story is likely to endure  keeping prices depressed for an  extended period of time   the issue has already been reported and is therefore no longer news  suggesting the selloff was exaggerated 

Technically  however  the price may be forming a double bottom  which would be complete if the price of the stock falls below 118 
For the week  the Dow was down 1 18   The decline brought the total selloff since the index s April record high to 10 17  
The NASDAQ Composite was the clear underperformer on Friday  plunging 2 26   On a weekly basis  however  it outperformed the other major indices  trimming just 0 84 for the week  reflecting the wild mood swings investors are going through  The tech heavy index has fallen 14 8  since its February record high 
The small cap Russell 2000 was the week s outperformer  falling only 1 72  on Friday  That s ironic considering the positive trade related reports  Small caps have tended to fall on an improved outlook on exports  since that benefits multinationals at the expenses of domestic firms 
But  as with the NASDAQ  we re seeing a divergence between market activity on Friday versus the rest of the week  The small caps index dropped 2 57  for the week  making it the worst performer on that basis  reflecting market volatility from another perspective  So far  the Russell 2000 has dropped 19 percent since its August record peak  That leaves it just 1 percent away from a bear market 
Just prior to Friday s market rout  another sign of investor pessimism surfaced when Utilities shares hit an all time high on Thursday  That s a red flag for risk assets  signaling that investors are losing faith in growth 

Technically  the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLU   which is a proxy for the sector  is trading at the top of a rising channel  whose supply line may push prices back toward the channel bottom  but still remain within an uptrend 

The yield on 10 year Treasurys dropped Friday  as investors rotated out of equities  However  on a weekly basis  they ended higher  confirming the support of a previous resistance  the supply line since mid 2015  as well as the uptrend line since mid 2016 
The pressure at these two converging trendlines is a visual representation of the current market dynamic  Should yields fall below 2 8  they would increase the bearish picture  as demand for Treasurys will break through a confluence of supports  demonstrating increasing pessimism in growth 

Though the dollar fell on Friday  it advanced for the week  Technically  it s being squeezed within a rising wedge  which is bearish in a downtrend  Note the set up for a downside breakout  the contracting moving averages beneath the price action  Also  the RSI is setting up a double top  with a neckline at the 51 level 

In mirror image of the global reserve currency  the price of gold is set to scale above the 200 DMA  as it trades within a rising channel  which may boost the precious metal further 

The price of oil also fell on Friday  The commodity stayed within its pennant  whose downside breakout would signal a resumption of the underlying downtrend  However  should prices meander through the apex  the pattern s bearish bias would fizzle 
Elsewhere  UK Prime Minister Theresa May may have won last week s parliamentary confidence vote  but she left the EU summit empty handed  Still  it s possible France s President Emmanuel Macron may have had an even worse week  He back pedaled on a fuel tax hike and on a tax on pension benefits while introducing monthly bonuses of 100 euro to minimum wage workers to quell 4 weeks of violent protests 
That package will add approximately  10 billion to France s budget deficit  pushing it well above the EU limit of 3  of GDP  This move could not have come at a worse time for the EU  after it coerced Italy with disciplinary measures to reduce that country s deficit to below 2  
The ECB added to growing concerns of economic growth and geopolitical upheavals  During last week s press conference the European central bank reduced its growth outlook  even as it winds down QE

272610,AAPL,S P  NASDAQ Rise For The Week Despite Friday Drop,opinion,"A rough Friday session ruined the Dow s chance for another positive week  but the other major indices managed to a hang on as we closed out an encouraging start to earnings season

	The NASDAQ dropped 0 83   or about 67 points  to 8089 54  Shares of Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  plunged more than 6  as it appears the honeymoon is over for its initially well regarded Q3 report

	The Dow got the worst of it today with a slide of 0 95   or more than 255 points  to 26 770 20  But to be fair  most of that deficit stems from a nearly 7  loss at Boeing  NYSE BA  after a story that the airplane giant misled federal authorities on the safety of the 737 Max

433144,MS,WRAPUP 1 US jobless claims fall sharply  buoy recovery hopes,news,"  U S  weekly new jobless claims fall sharply last week
   Number of workers on long term unemployment aid rises
   White House says labor market to improve slowly
   Some retailers report sales less steep than expected
 By Lucia Mutikani
 WASHINGTON  Aug 6  Reuters    The number of laid off U S 
workers submitting new claims for jobless benefits fell sharply
last week  fanning hopes the fragile labor market was on the
mend and that the broader economy was stabilizing 
 Initial claims for state unemployment insurance fell 38 000
to a seasonally adjusted 550 000 in the week ended Aug  1  the
Labor Department said on Thursday  beating market expectations
for a drop to 580 000 
 In a sign that the trend was firmly toward a moderation in
the pace of layoffs  the four week moving average for new
claims fell 4 750 to 555 250 in the week ended Aug  1 
 The four week moving average is considered a better gauge
of underlying trends as it irons out week to week volatility 
The moving average has declined for six consecutive weeks 
 However  the number of people collecting long term
unemployment benefits rose by 69 000 to 6 31 million in the
week ended July 25  though the four week moving average
declined for four straight weeks 
 Analysts said the report  which followed data on Wednesday
showing steeper private sector job cuts and declining
non manufacturing employment in July  restored optimism that
the labor market was starting to heal 
  The U S  labor market is on the mend  This corroborates
our view that the pace of layoffs has slowed down noticeably  
said Harm Bandholz  an economist at Unicredit Markets  
Investment Banking in New York 
 Top White House economic adviser Christina Romer cautioned 
though  that economic recovery will be painful and that
Friday s widely watched report on July unemployment likely will
show hundreds of thousands more jobs were lost 
 U S  stocks opened higher   but better sentiment over
the jobless claims report quickly fizzled as biotech shares
dropped following the downgrading of Celgene Corp  
Government bond prices recouped earlier losses to trade
unchanged from Wednesday s levels  
 The jobless claims data  came ahead of the release of
July s non farm payrolls report  and may have signaled the
20 month old recession was winding down  analysts said 
  The claims data are another sign that the recession could
be behind us   said Kevin Flanagan  fixed income strategist for
Global Wealth Management at Morgan Stanley in Purchase  New
York 
  I am optimistic that a recovery is in the process of
beginning  but we will need to see continued improvement in
claims going through  below  the 500 000 level before the
consumer is willing to come on board and be part of the
recovery   he added 
 A Reuters survey forecast that Friday s U S  Labor
Department report will show 320 000 workers lost their jobs in
July  the least for any month since September when employers
cut 321 000 jobs 
 But the jobless rate may climb to 9 6 percent    the
highest since June 1983    from 9 5 percent in June  as
employers remain reluctant to hire because of subdued demand 
 ECONOMY STABILIZING
 Romer  who chairs the White House Council of Economic
Advisers  said on Thursday the U S  government s  787 billion
stimulus program was stabilizing the economy despite
 unacceptable  job losses that may continue for some time 
  Unfortunately  even once GDP  gross domestic product 
begins to grow  it will likely take still longer for employment
to stop falling and begin to rise   she said   ID nN06315673 
 Analysts said the sharp drop in jobless claims applications
last week was more evidence that employers had cut way too many
jobs as the economy sank in the first quarter 
  Business overdid things earlier in the year  The huge
layoffs we had were not justified     we are anticipating that
we will see  jobless claims  numbers like this frequently going
froward   said Milton Ezrati  senior economist at Lord Abbett
in Jersey City in New Jersey 
 Labor market weakness is casting a shadow over the
economy s recovery prospects from the worst recession in over
60 years as high unemployment exerts pressure on incomes 
severely curtailing households  spending capacity 
 Consumer spending is the main driver of U S  economic
activity and there are some signs that shoppers may be coming
back to the malls 
 Some U S  retailers on Thursday reported sales declines for
July were not as steep as expected  although same store sales
were likely to fall for an 11th straight month  For details see

395740,WDC,Toshiba off Tokyo bourse s special watchlist  but ISS critical of accounting,news,By Makiko Yamazaki TOKYO  Reuters    The Tokyo bourse said on Wednesday it was taking Toshiba Corp off a special watchlist  citing improved internal controls   a move that lessens but does not completely remove the risk of a delisting for the embattled conglomerate  But offering a starkly different view of Toshiba s accounting practices  proxy advisory firm ISS said it has recommended that Toshiba s shareholders do not approve the firm s earnings statements for the past financial year after a mixed review from its auditor  Toshiba was placed on the bourse s watchlist in the wake of a 2015 accounting scandal  It plunged into crisis again as of late last year after billions of dollars in liabilities emerged at its now bankrupt U S  nuclear unit Westinghouse   problems that also raised fresh accounting concerns  Aiming to plug the hole in its balance sheet  the Japanese company last month agreed to sell its chip unit to a consortium led by U S  private equity firm Bain Capital for  18 billion  although the deal still needs to clear regulatory reviews and overcome legal challenges   The market had been expecting that the Tokyo bourse will remove Toshiba from the list and allow it to remain listed because the firm is too big to fail   said Masayuki Otani  chief market analyst at Securities Japan  Not only does the Japanese government see Toshiba s chip business as vital to its national interests  the conglomerate s domestic nuclear business is also key to the decommissioning of the Fukushima plants damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami  But the Tokyo stock exchange could come under further pressure to delist Toshiba if it is in negative net worth for a second year in a row at the end of March   a very real possibility as the chip deal may not gain regulatory clearance by then and it may struggle to raise funds by other means  S P Global Ratings said this month that there was  over a one in three chance that Toshiba will fail to receive sale proceeds and resolve its insolvency by March 31   If shareholders do not sign off on Toshiba s earnings at a Oct  24 extraordinary meeting as recommended by ISS  that could also imperil Toshiba s ability to the recover from the crisis  Japanese shareholders  however  rarely reject proposals by management  Auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata LLC gave Toshiba s financial statements a  qualified opinion  that endorsed Toshiba s finances despite some minor problems  but also made an  adverse  statement on Toshiba s internal controls   It would be difficult to justify support for this resolution given the fact that the audit firm has rendered a qualified opinion  basically reflecting the auditor s view that Toshiba s financial statements are not accurate   ISS said  The controversy over Toshiba s internal controls comes just as questions over corporate governance in Japan have taken the spotlight again  with a Kobe Steel Ltd crisis deepening on fresh revelations of data fabrication  Separately  Toshiba said on Wednesday it would invest an additional 110 billion yen   980 million  in the Fab 6 chip production line in Yokkaichi  central Japan  on top of a planned initial investment of 195 billion yen  Toshiba also said it has recently asked Western Digital s SanDisk unit whether it intends to jointly participate in the investment  Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC   Toshiba s joint chip venture partner  objects to any sale without its consent  and is seeking an injunction to block the deal in the International Court of Arbitration ,2017-10-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/toshiba-shares-to-be-removed-from-special-watch-list-nikkei-539753,539753

In the last two quarters  the U S  economy recorded the fastest six month growth in four years and is on track to hit the Trump administration s annual growth target of 3   If that happens  it would be the best yearly performance since 2005  two years before the Great Recession 
Notably  all the 17 non manufacturing industries reported expansion  including education services  transportation and warehousing  utilities  real estate  finance   insurance  healthcare  construction  mining  retail trade  agriculture and information  to name a few 
Business Activity   New Orders Improve  Employment Subindex Falls
The gauge of U S  service industries rose mostly on gains in business activity and new orders  Business expectations issued in November for the days ahead continue to be encouraging  The business activity index came in at 65 2  showing an increase of 2 7 percentage points from the October reading of 62 5  This showed an uptick in business activity for the 112th straight month

The index for new orders jumped to 62 5 in November from October s reading 61 5  New orders  thus  increased for the 94th successive month  The pick up in new orders suggests that the service sector is poised to gain traction in the coming months

260510,DIS,Better Long Term Buy  Amazon  AMZN  Vs  Microsoft  MSFT  Stock ,opinion,"Shares of both Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   have been hurt by the recent market downturn that has seen the likes of Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX    and other tech giants fall  With that said  both AMZN and MSFT are still up big over the last year and the companies are headed in the right direction 
AMZN Overview 
Amazon s Q3 revenues climbed by 29  to reach  56 6 billion  which fell short of Wall Street estimates and helped show that its days of massive top line growth might be over simply because of its size  Still  the tech powerhouse is projected to grab roughly 50  of the total U S  e commerce market in 2018    Plus  Amazon s advertising business is set to expand as more and more product searches begin on its site 
Jeff Bezos  firm is now the third largest digital advertiser behind only Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Google   NASDAQ GOOGL    On top of that  Amazon has expanded into the pharmaceutical industry and its Prime Video platform looks poised to stand out against Netflix and soon enough Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   and Disney   NYSE DIS   as it pushes deeper into live sports  And let s not forget that Amazon is still a cloud computing powerhouse 

MSFT Overview 
Speaking of cloud computing  Microsoft is the  cloud provider behind only Amazon having grabbed roughly 14  of the cloud market in the third quarter  This put MSFT in front of IBM   NYSE IBM    Google  and Alibaba   NYSE BABA    On top of that  the historic tech firm has continued to dive deeper into artificial intelligence and IoT 
Meanwhile  the company has bolstered its business through some significant acquisitions  which includes its June purchase of open source software powerhouse GitHub  Microsoft also landed some major contracts for its cloud and AI business this year  including Walmart   NYSE WMT    And let s not forget that its personal computing business is massive and helped its most recent quarterly revenues jump 19  to  29 1 billion 
Stock Price Movement 
As we mentioned at the top  both AMZN and MSFT have seen their stock prices fall recently  Amazon stock is down 16  over the last three months  while Microsoft dipped just around 2   Yet  Amazon stock has blown away MSFT over the last decade  but that doesn t really tell us much since the e commerce firm has been on one of the most impressive runs in Wall Street history 
Investors should note that MSFT stock hovered at around  110 per share through late afternoon trading Friday  which marked a roughly 5  downturn from its 52 week and all time high  Meanwhile  Amazon stock sat approximately 18  below its recent highs at around  1 686 a share 
 
 
Outlook 
Looking ahead  Amazon is expected to see its Q4 revenues climb roughly 18 5  to reach  71 61 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company s total fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to jump 30 8  to  232 69 billion  Plus  Amazon s full year 2019 revenues are expected to climb over 20  above our current 2018 estimate 
At the bottom end of the income statement  Amazon s adjusted fourth quarter revenues are projected to skyrocket 153 7  to  5 48 per share  Meanwhile  AMZN s fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to soar 328   
Microsoft s outlook is a bit less impressive  which is to be expected based on its age  MSFT s current quarter revenues are expected to jump 12 2  to  32 46 billion  The company s full year revenues are projected to climb at a similar rate to reach  124 08 billion with the following year expected to jump 10  above that 
Furthermore  Microsoft s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to climb by 13 5  to hit  1 09 per share  while its full year EPS figure is expected to expand by over 14  

Bottom Line
Both Amazon and Microsoft have strong management teams and have expanded their offerings to better position themselves for the future  We should note that MSFT has earned more positive earnings estimate revisions recently  Plus  Microsoft has been a dividend payer for years and its valuation picture trading at 23 7X forward earnings estimates compared to Amazon s 64 3X looks much better than its peer 
On the other hand  Amazon will likely pay a dividend once its outsized growth starts to slow  But Bezos and Amazon are poised to continue to expand into as many new industries as possible  Therefore  it seems like it is a toss up between Amazon and Microsoft at the moment since both stocks offer investors different benefits

258885,DIS,Darth Dorian  Hurricane nixes some  Star Wars  fans  Disney dream trips,news,"By Matthew Lavietes
 Reuters    Some  Star Wars  fans who have waited decades to see the Millennium Falcon  blue milk and other artifacts of the long ago  far  far away  universe up close will have to wait just a little longer  thanks to Hurricane Dorian 
The storm is bearing down on Florida just as Orlando s Walt  Disney   NYSE DIS  World resort is opening its  Star Wars  Galaxy s Edge  attraction for the Labor Day holiday weekend  prompting some travelers to cancel their trips 
 This was going to be a big deal vacation  Seeing Galaxy s Edge for the first time was making it different from any other trip   said Jill Benedict  The 34 year old owner of a Lake Orion  Michigan  travel agency  who bought tickets for herself  her husband  her sister and her sister s boyfriend the morning they went on sale  decided not to risk traveling into a potentially massive storm 
 My sister and I got in a very bad argument about it on Wednesday evening   Benedict said by telephone on Friday   It was pretty epic  
Thousands of tourists have packed into the attraction since it opened on Thursday  even as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency ahead of the impending storm  warning coastal residents to stock up on water  food and medicine 
Disney officials did not respond to queries about whether the park would remain open through the storm  though it has closed for prior hurricanes  including 2017 s Hurricane Irma 
Some travelers with experience of storms opted not to risk it 
 The thought of paying  4 500 to go sit in a hotel for a week  possibly without power  was not appealing at all   said Ashley Touart  a 31 year old chemical process engineer from Mobile  Alabama  who had planned to visit with her husband and mother 
 We re from the Gulf Coast  So we know that if a Cat 3 or 4 comes on shore  you re without power and it s absolutely miserable   Touart said  referring to the categories on the five step Saffir Simpson measure of hurricane strength 
But not all fans were deterred  Stacey Fox  a 37 year old paralegal from Fairmont West  Virginia  planned to go with her husband  parents and sister anyway  She noted that her father  who prefers not to fly  was driving a car filled with food and supplies in case the family gets stranded 
 Is it the least dangerous thing that we could do to go  No   Fox said   But is it the most dangerous thing  Not by a long shot  ",2019-08-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/darth-dorian-hurricane-nixes-some-star-wars-fans-disney-dream-trips-1967605,1967605
375143,NWSA,1994 Bond Repeat Or 2013 Stock Defeat ,opinion,Interest rates are moving higher  bond prices are collapsing  and fear regarding a stock market plunge is palpable  Sound like a recent news headline or is this a description of a 1994 financial market story  For those with a foggy  double decade old memory  here is a summary of the 1994 economic environment The economy registered its 34thmonth of expansion and the stock market was on a record 40 month advanceThe Federal Reserve embarked on its multi hike  rate tightening monetary policyThe 10 year Treasury note exhibited an almost 2 5  jump in yieldsInflation was low with a threat of rising inflation lurking in the backgroundAn upward sloping yield curve encouraged speculative bond carry trade activity  borrow short  invest long Globalization and technology sped up the pace of price volatilityMany of these listed items resemble factors experienced today  but bond losses in 1994 were much larger than the losses of 2013   at least so far  At the time  Fortune magazine called the 1994 bond collapse the worst bond market loss in history  with losses estimated at upwards of  1 5 trillion  The rout started with what might have appeared as a harmless 0 25  increase in the Federal Funds rate  the rate that banks lend to each other  from 3  to 3 25  in February 1994  By the time 1994 came to a close  acting Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had jacked up this main monetary tool by 2 5  Rising rates may have acted as the flame for bond losses  but extensive use of derivatives and leverage acted as the gasoline  For example  over extended Eurobond positions bought on margin by famed hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt of Steinhardt Partners lead to losses of about 30   or approximately  1 5 billion   Renowned partner of Omega Partners  Leon Cooperman  took a similar beating  Cooperman s  3 billion fund cratered  24  during the first half of 1994  Insurance company bond portfolios were hit hard too  as collective losses for the industry exceeded  20 billion  or more than the claims paid for Hurricane Andrew s damage  Let s not forget the largest casualty of this era   the public collapse of Orange County  California  Poor derivatives trades led to  1 7 billion in losses and ultimately forced the county into bankruptcy There are plenty of other examples  but suffice it to say  the pain felt by other bond investors was widespread as a massive number of margin calls caused a snowball of bond liquidations  The speed of the decline was intensified as bond holders began selling short and using derivatives to hedge their portfolios  accelerating price declines Just as the accommodative interest rate punch bowl was eventually removed by Greenspan  so too is Ben Bernanke  current Fed Chairman  threatening to do today  Even if Bernanke unleashes a cold turkey tapering of the  85 billion per month in bond purchases  massive losses in bond values won t necessarily mean catastrophe for stock values  For evidence  one needs to look no further than this 1994 1995 chart of the stock market Volatility for stocks definitely increased in 1994 with the S P 500 index correcting about  10  early in the year  But as you can see  by the end of the year the market was off to the races  tripling in value over the next five years  Volatility has been the norm for the current bull market rally as well  Despite the more than doubling in stock prices since early 2009  we have experienced two  20  corrections and one  10  pullback What s more  the onset of potential tapering is completely consistent with core economic principles  Capitalism is built on free trading markets  not artificial intervention  Extraordinary times required extraordinary measures  but the probabilities of a massive financial Armageddon have been severely diminished  As a result  the unprecedented scale of quantitative easing  QE  will eventually become more harmful than beneficial  The moral of the story is that volatility is always a normal occurrence in the equity markets  therefore any significant stock pullback associated with potential bond tapering  or fed fund rate hikes  shouldn t be viewed as the end of the world  nor should a temporary weakening in stock prices be viewed as the end to the bull market in stocks Why have stocks historically provided higher returns than bonds  The short answer is that stocks are riskier than bonds  The price for these higher long term returns is volatility  and if investors can t handle volatility  then they shouldn t be investing in stocks If you are an investor that thinks they can time the market  you wouldn t be wasting your time reading this article  Rather  you d be spending time on your personal island while drinking coconut drinks with umbrellas   Although there are some distinct similarities between the economic backdrop of 1994 and 2013  there are quite a few differences also  For starters  the economy was growing at a much healthier clip then   4 1  GDP growth   which stoked inflationary fears in the mind of Greenspan  Moreover  unemployment was quite low  5 5  by year end vs  7 6  today  and the Fed did not communicate forward looking Fed policy back then   It s unclear if the recent 50 basis point ascent in 10 year Treasury rates was just an appetizer for what s to come  but simple mathematics indicate there is really only one direction left for interest rates to go higher  If history repeats itself  it will likely be bond investors choking on higher rates  not stock investors   For the sake of optimistic bond speculators  I hope Ben Bernanke knows the Heimlich maneuver  Studying history may help bond bulls avoid indigestion  DISCLOSURE  Sidoxia Capital Management  SCM  and

441050,WFC,U S  business spending weak in May  Brexit seen adding more pressure,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    New orders for U S  manufactured capital goods unexpectedly fell in May as demand declined broadly  indicating business spending will remain a drag on economic growth in the second quarter 
The subdued business investment persists despite data on retail sales  housing and layoffs suggesting the economy has regained speed after growth stalled at the start of the year 
Economists say uncertainty over the global economy and the upcoming U S  presidential elections are making companies cautious about spending and that uncertainty is likely to be exacerbated by Britain s shock vote to leave the European Union on Thursday 
 The surprising  leave  outcome of the British referendum will result in the intensification of these uncertainties  potentially hampering business capital investment   said Millan Mulraine  deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York 
The U S  Commerce Department said on Friday non defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft  a closely watched proxy for business spending plans  fell 0 7 percent last month after dropping 0 4 percent in April  These so called core capital goods orders had been forecast to rise 0 3 percent in May 
Core capital goods orders have increased in only six of the last 17 months  With core capital goods orders falling for a second straight month in May  spending on equipment will likely continue to weigh on economic growth in the second quarter 
Shipments of core capital goods  which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government s gross domestic product measurement  slipped 0 5 percent last month after rising 0 6 percent in April  Shipments were little changed in March 
U S  business spending on equipment has declined over the last two quarters  It dropped in the first quarter at its quickest pace since the second quarter of 2009 
Should spending on equipment fall in the second quarter  that would be the first time since the recession of 2008 that it would have contracted for three straight quarters 
Weak business spending and uncertainty over the so called  Brexit  referendum make it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the near term 
A separate report on Friday showed U S  consumer sentiment ebbed in June as Americans anticipated slower economic growth in the year ahead 
U S  financial markets were little affected by the durable goods orders data on Friday as investors were more concerned about the costs of Brexit  The U S  dollar jumped against a basket of currencies and prices for U S  government debt rallied on safe haven bids while U S  stock prices tumbled in line with share markets globally 
GROWING UNCERTAINTY
Following the weak core capital goods orders figures  the Atlanta Fed lowered its second quarter GDP estimate by two tenths of a percentage point to a 2 6 percent annual rate  The economy grew at a 0 8 percent pace in the first quarter 
With business spending remaining weak  manufacturing is showing no signs of pulling out of the slump that started in mid 2014 which was precipitated by a surge in the U S  dollar 
Manufacturing has also been undermined by lower oil prices which have put pressure on producers of energy related equipment and efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang have also inflected pain 
Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the U S  economy 
Last month  overall orders for durable goods  items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more  fell 2 2 percent after surging 3 3 percent in April 
There were declines in orders for machinery  primary metals  computers and electronic products as electrical equipment  appliances and components  Orders for transportation equipment plunged 5 6 percent as demand for automobiles fell 2 8 percent 
After the U S  dollar retreated this year against the currencies of the United States  main trading partners and with oil prices gradually rising  there had been hope that the worst of the manufacturing downturn was over 
But economists now worry that Britain s departure from the European Union could spur fresh economic weakness which could hurt global growth  and put downward pressure on oil prices and boost the appeal of the U S  dollar 
 For the U S  industrial sector  the outlook for global demand looks weaker this morning than it did just a day ago given the added uncertainties surrounding the U K  and euro area economies   said Tim Quinlan  a senior economist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  in Charlotte  North Carolina ",2016-06-24,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-business-spending-weak-in-may,-brexit-seen-adding-more-pressure-410440",410440

encompassed such bellwethers of high tech trade as South Korea and Taiwan  The official version of China s PMI survey for manufacturing slipped to 49 4 in January from 49 7  The services index also disappointed  challenging hopes consumption would take over from industry as the driving force  A private survey  the Caixin Markit China Manufacturing PMI  underscored the trend by showing factory activity shrinking for an 11th month   The electricity production remained sluggish and the crude steel output continued the weak trend in January  reflecting an ongoing deleveraging process in the industrial sectors   said Zhou Hao  an economist at Commerzbank  DE CBKG    In the meantime  China has started an aggressive capacity reduction in many sectors  which could add downward pressure on the bulk commodity prices over time   he said   Japan s results were more encouraging  Its factory barometer slipped only a tick to 52 3 in January as exports picked up  The gains in exports relied on a weak yen  hinting at another reason the BOJ acted so boldly when it introduced negative interest rates last week   India also recorded an unexpected return to growth  Its erratic PMI jumped to a four month high after slumping to a 28 month low in December  Other countries in the region were not so fortunate  South Korea s manufacturing index slipped into contraction  Its exports suffered their sharpest annual fall since August 2009  China is South Korea s largest market  taking about a quarter of its exports  The story was much the same for another electronics hub  Taiwan  where factory growth slowed amid lackluster demand  EUROPE SLOWS Factory growth across the euro zone slowed at the start of 2016 as incoming orders failed to show any meaningful increase  even though companies cut prices at the deepest rate for a year  the Markit survey on Monday  The Markit manufacturing PMI for the euro zone dropped to 52 3 from December s 53 2    The euro zone s manufacturing economy missed a beat at the start of the year  Growth of order books  exports and output all slowed   said Chris Williamson  chief economist at survey compiler Markit   If the slowdown in business activity wasn t enough to worry policymakers  prices charged by producers fell at the fastest rate for a year to spur further concern about deflation becoming ingrained   With eurozone consumer price inflation at only 0 4 percent last month  nowhere near the ECB s target of around 2 0 percent  the ECB is likely to cut its deposit rate even further into negative territory when it meets next month  a Reuters poll found last week   British factories enjoyed a brighter start to the year than expected  helped by surging output at large manufacturers  but companies cut staff at the fastest rate in three years and export orders fell  a survey showed on Monday  The British Markit CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers  index rose to a three month high of 52 9 in January from 52 1 in December  AMERICAS SLUGGISH In the United States  the Markit manufacturing PMI rose slightly  to 52 4 in January from 51 2 in December   An alternative reading from the U S  Institute of Supply Management  ISM  showed manufacturing activity in January contracted for the fourth month in a row  though at a slightly slower pace  with the index at 48 2 from 48 0 the previous month  Canadian factory activity also contracted but at a slower pace in January  The RBC Markit Canadian Manufacturing Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  edged up to 49 3 last month from 47 5 in December  The six month stretch below 50 is the longest since the survey began in late 2010   While Canadian business conditions continued to deteriorate in January  we saw signs of stabilization in the manufacturing industry supported by strong export sales alongside a pick up in the U S  economy and a weakening Canadian dollar   said Craig Wright  chief economist at RBC  Brazil s manufacturing activity also contracted in January  but at the slowest pace in nearly one year  according to Markit

305668,BA,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Fed Minutes Eyed for Rate Hike Clues
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday releases the minutes of its previous meeting due 2 00 p m  ET 
Traders are expected to parse the minutes for clues about future rate hikes and a possible update on the central bank s efforts to unwind its massive  4 2 trillion balance sheet 
Investors are keen to get a sense of the Fed s monetary policy plans for next year as inflation has reached the 2  target  and unemployment has dropped below 4     the lowest since 2000 
In its July 31 Aug  1 meeting  the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged and gave an upbeat assessment of the economy  leaving little doubt that the central bank will meet expectations and raise rates next month 
But President Trump has been highly critical over the Fed s rate hikes  calling on the central bank to do more to boost U S  growth 
While Trump s remarks are not expected to influence Fed policymakers  the dollar sold off sharply Tuesday to a nearly two week low 
2  U S  Housing Data  China U S  Talks Get Underway
U S  housing activity is expected to show a rebound after an unexpected fall in June 
Existing Home Sales due 10 00 a m  ET for July is expected to show a rise of 0 6  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 44 million units  after falling 0 6  in June 
The fall in June was blamed on a mismatch between the growing level of homebuyer demand and the declining pace of home sales 
Elsewhere  the United States and China are set to return to the negotiating table on Wednesday  to hash out their differences on trade  but market participants are not expecting much in the way of progress from the mid level talks 
Yet it is hoped the dialogue would pave the way for more meaningful talks in the future that could lead to the end of the trade war as early as November  when President Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are due to meet 
Any murmurs from the trade talks could determine direction for trade sensitive stocks such as  Boeing Co   NYSE BA  and  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT    both have significant international exposure  
3  Energy Information Administration s Weekly Inventory Report on Tap
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration  EIA  on Wednesday is expected to show that U S  crude stockpiles fell last week after an unexpected climb in the prior week 
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 1 497 million barrels in the week ended Aug  17  Domestic crude output   which rose for the first time in three weeks to 10 9 million barrels a day in the prior week   is also likely to garner investor attention

359053,GOOGL,Verizon  VZ    AT T  T  Submit Third Round Bids For Yahoo,opinion,"According to a report by Bloomberg  the struggling web portal operator Yahoo  Inc    NASDAQ YHOO   received five bids for the final round of bidding for its core assets 
Notable among the bidders are U S  telecom behemoths Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   and AT T Inc    NYSE T    The other three bidders are a consortium led by Quicken Loans Inc  founder Dan Gilbert and backed by Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa  Chairman Warren Buffett  a partnership of Vector Capital Management and Sycamore Partners and private equity firm TPG Capital LP 
Citing an unnamed source  Bloomberg stated that out of the five  Verizon  Quicken Loans and Vector Capital Management are likely to be the top bidders  The deadline for submitting the final round of bids was this Monday  Yahoo is expected to declare the winning bidder next week after examining all three bids 
Internet based information service provider giant Yahoo is currently struggling with its core businesses namely mail service  online sports  financial and general news sections and its vital online advertising technology  which includes the video advertising platform  BrightRoll 
In Feb 2016  Yahoo disclosed that it would consider  strategic alternatives  for its core businesses  including an outright sale or a spin off  Notably  Yahoo boasts a significant user base that trails only Google of Alphabet Inc    NASDAQ GOOGL   and Facebook Inc    NASDAQ FB   
Yahoo was initially expecting to collect around  6 billion from the sale of its core Internet based products  The company was also expecting to collect  0 5 billion to  1 billion from the sale of its non core assets which consist of its 3 000 patents and real estate properties 
As per Bloomberg  Verizon s second bid was in the range of  3 75 billion to  4 billion for the core assets of Yahoo while AT T s bid was around  5 billion which include both core and non core assets  Both bid sizes were much less than what were initially anticipated by Yahoo  The reason may be the dwindling business of Yahoo  According to the research firm eMarketer Inc   this year Yahoo will control just 1 5  of the overall digital advertising market  down from 2 1  in 2015 
Bottom Line
Yahoo has not even been able to maintain its sales and profits  let alone grow  This is very disconcerting for a company that has been trying to turn itself around for many years now  Thus  any buyer putting high stakes on the bidding table will be great news for shareholders  On the other hand  Yahoo employees stand to benefit if either of the telecom giants vertically integrates Yahoo s assets more profitably  Only time will unravel what is in the cards for this once leading Internet giant YAHOO  INC Price

company s 2016 huge disposition activity  However  the negative was partly mitigated by enhanced NOI from same store properties and lease up NOI Moreover  the company met estimates in three occasions

and EPS Surprise    Will Equity Residential be able to overcome challenges this time and post a surprise  Or will a challenging backdrop hurt its financials this earnings season  Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderEquity Residential is poised to benefit from its portfolio repositioning efforts  household growth  favorable demographics  lifestyle transformation and low unemployment  The company made concerted efforts toward repositioning the portfolio from low barrier to entry non core markets to high barrier to entry core markets  and opted for substantial sale out of its portfolio in 2016 However  increasing new apartment supply in majority of the company s markets  along with declining growth in high paying jobs  is likely to put pressure on rental rates  thereby adversely affecting the company s revenue growth this year  In fact  according to the company  the slowdown in same store revenue growth  which started in 2016  is likely to weaken in 2017 as well  There is also high concession activity amid increased supply Moreover  though the assets sale might help the company focus exclusively on its core  high density urban markets over the long term  the earnings dilution impact from such a move cannot be bypassed in the near term  These issues are anticipated to affect the company s net operating income in the to be reported quarter For first quarter 2017  Equity Residential projects normalized funds from operations  FFO  per share in the range of 71 75 cents The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at 74 cents  However  Equity Residential s activities during the quarter could not gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged

the industry Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Equity Residential will beat on estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a

difference between the Most Accurate estimate of 73 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents  is  1 35   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

251175,INTC,FOREX Dollar firm on yen after jump  rate view helps,news,"  Dollar holds ground versus yen after Friday s surge
   Spike in U S  yields supports dlr yen
   Investor focus on U S  third qtr earnings
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY  Oct 12  Reuters    The U S  dollar held above recent
14 month lows against a basket of currencies on Monday as traders
trimmed some of their short dollar positions on prospects that
U S  interest rates will move up earlier than expected 
 Fed fund futures are now pricing in a funds rate of 0 32
percent in the March contract  0 FF    up from near zero  after
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said late last week that
policy could be tightened as a recovery takes hold 
 Those comments  although not new  led to a huge sell off in
Treasuries with benchmark U S  government bond yields rising to
two week highs on Friday   US  
  In a market hypersensitive to monetary tightening comments
after Australia s surprise hike  these comments were enough to
send bonds lower and the U S  dollar higher   said Matthew
Strauss  senior currency analyst at RBC Capital 
  However  this was a mere drop in an otherwise bucket of U S 
dollar bearishness  
 The dollar held firm at 89 82 yen   having jumped
nearly 1 6 percent on Friday  It had surged higher with the
market caught short and stops being triggered 
 Analysts say rising Treasury yields are likely to keep the
upward pressure against the yen although resistance is seen
around 90 20 yen 
 Trade is expected to be light on Monday with holidays in
Japan and U S 
 The dollar index   USD  was at 76 319  off a 14 month low of
75 767  struck on Oct 8  The dollar was under relentless pressure
last week as the prospect of U S  interest rates remaining low
for a while led to a huge sell off 
 The fall has fuelled talk the U S  dollar was becoming the
preferred funding currency  replacing the yen  for leveraged
carry trades 
 Data from CFTC showed the value of the dollar s net short
position rose to  20 2 billion in the week ended Oct 6  up from
 16 6 billion a week earlier   IMM FX 
 The euro  inched up to  1 4732  having lost 0 48
percent on Friday  The euro advanced to 132 37 yen from 132 18
yen  late on Friday  The yen ceded ground on the
high flying Australian dollar  which rose to two month highs of
81 29 yen  
 The Australian dollar  stayed above 90 U S  cents 
buoyed by expectations of further rate hikes 
 This week  the Aussie is likely to take cue from Wall Street
where U S  third quarter earnings season picks up 
 Some of the big corporate names scheduled to post earnings
this week are Intel Corp   Johnson   Johnson  on
Tuesday  JP Morgan Chase  on Wednesday  Goldman Sachs
 and IBM  on Thursday and Bank of America 
and General Electic  on Friday

410758,UAA,Here s What To Expect From Dick s Sporting Goods  DKS  Q3 Earnings,opinion,"Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS   saw its stock price pop 0 94  during regular trading Tuesday in a sign that investors might expect big things from the retailer s Q3 financial results  especially after Foot Locker s   NYSE FL   quarterly earnings impressed last week  
Foot Locker stock soared last week after the sports retailer posted better than expected top and bottom line results  The company s comparable store sales also jumped 2 9   Foot Locker benefited from the fact that Nike   NYSE NKE    Adidas   OTC ADDYY    and Under Armour   NYSE UAA   have more selective wholesale businesses these days as they focus on their own direct to consumer sales DKS Q3 Outlook 
Dick s Q3 revenues are projected to fall 3 6  to hit  1 87 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  At the bottom end of the income statement  the company s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to plummet 13 3  from the year ago period to reach  0 26 per share 
With that said  we still need to know how likely it is that Dick s will top our quarterly earnings estimate since a beat could help its stock price climb in the near term  Luckily  we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure to help us 
 
The Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Dick s Sporting Goods recent positive earnings estimate revision activity helps the company earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The company also sports an Earnings ESP of 7 35   Therefore  investors can consider DKS a firm that could top our quarterly earnings estimate Wednesday  However  we should remember that the retailer s overall Q3 outlook doesn t appear strong 
Dick s Sporting Goods is scheduled to release its Q3 financial results before the market opens on Wednesday

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON  June 1  Reuters    World stocks and oil rallied to
fresh 2009 highs on Monday while the dollar hit 5 month lows
after evidence of improvement in global factory activity
reinforced expectations that the world economy is recovering 
Such optimism triggered broad based flows into riskier
investment   including stocks  oil  commodities and emerging
market assets    and offset long expected news that General
Motors will file for bankruptcy  which would be the third
largest in the United States 
 Surveys released on Monday showed the manufacturing sector
posted modest growth in China and improvement was seen in India 
Russia  Britain and the euro zone 
  The most important theme is that real money investors are
busy getting back to at least neutral positioning in risky
assets  that is providing a boost   said Beat Siegenthaler 
chief emerging markets strategist  TD Securities 
MSCI world equity index rose 1 4 percent to its highest
since October  The index has risen 12 out of the past 13 weeks 
gaining 45 percent since its March low 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose almost 2 percent  while
emerging stocks gained 2 7 percent  hitting their highest since
September  The MSCI emerging equities index rose 16 7 percent
last month  its largest monthly rise in 20 years 
 U S  stock futures were up around 1 5 percent  pointing to a
firmer open on Wall Street 
 China s official purchasing managers  index fell slightly in
May to 53 1 from 53 5 in April  its third straight month above
the 50 mark  which separates expansion from contraction  
 In the euro zone  factory activity contracted at a much less
severe pace in May than in preceding months  with the region s
PMI index posting its biggest monthly jump in the survey s
12 year history by rising to 40 7 from 36 8 in April 
 The dollar fell 0 5 percent to hit a five month low against
a basket of major currencies  The low yielding yen fell 0 5
percent to 94 88 per dollar while sterling hit a seven month
high of  1 6432 
 The weaker U S  currency supported energy and commodities 
which are priced in dollars  U S  crude oil rose more than 2
percent to  68 29 a barrel  its highest since early November 
 Gold hit a three month high of  988 50 an ounce  its highest
since late February 
 Copper rose more than 2 percent to above  5 000 a tonne  its
highest level since mid October

data suggests that the worst is behind us   said David Thurtell

Senior bonds in the banks leaped after the rescue deal  For some unimaginable reason  bondholders seem to prefer taxpayers funding the purchase of bad loans over losing their investments  Although two small regional banks basically just went belly up and shareholders were wiped out  it was the shares of similarly sized banks that outperformed  The logic is quite sound  Italy has just shown the age of bailouts is not over  That significantly reduces the risk of an investment in a bank going sour

433557,C,Citigroup Earnings Expectations Plummet Post Fed Stress Test,opinion,"Citigroup Inc  NYSE C  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings before the market opens on Monday  April 14th  Citigroup is one of the largest banks in the United States and has been in headlines lately for all the wrong reasons  On March 26th the Federal Reserve rejected Citigroup s plan to boost its dividend and buyback more shares of company stock  On Friday 2 peer banks both reported earnings  JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo  JPMorgan missed earnings projections badly and the company stock fell 3 66   On the other hand Wells Fargo beat analysts  profit expectations by over 7    After Cti failed the Fed s recent stress test and had its capital plan rejected  analyst expectations on the Estimize com platform plunged  Here s what investors expect from Citigroup Monday morning 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Citigroup to report  1 18 EPS and  19 620B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 17 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  1 14 EPS and  19 394B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Citigroup  to miss the Wall Street consensus on both EPS and revenue 
Over the past 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting WFC s EPS and revenue 3 times each  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a small to moderate differential between the two groups  expectations 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  1 01 to  1 24 EPS and from  18 550B to  19 993B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a moderate distribution of estimates on Citigroup 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Over the past 4 months the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from  1 44 to  1 18 while the Estimize consensus dropped from  1 35 to  1 14  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus declined from  20 225B to  19 620B while the Estimize forecast sank from  21 145B to  19 394B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward analyst revenue revisions at the end of the quarter are often a bearish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is BradHewitt91 who projects  1 15 EPS and  19 450B in revenue  BradHewitt91 is ranked 13th overall among over 4 000 contributing analysts  Over the past year BradHewitt91 has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 52  and 50  of the time respectively throughout 664 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case BradHewitt91 is expecting Citigroup to outperform the low bar set by the Estimize community 
On Friday JPMorgan and Wells Fargo told conflicting tales about the banking industry through their earnings reports  Things have been rough on Citigroup lately and sentiment on the Estimize com platform has fallen dramatically since Citi s capital plan was rejected by the Federal Reserve  This quarter contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are expecting Citi to fail meet Wall Street s expectations on both EPS and revenue

272866,AAPL,Stock   Wall Street Surges on Powell s Promises,news,"Investing com   Stocks surged Tuesday in their biggest one day rally since January after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank stood ready to support the domestic economy if trade wars get too crazy 
The S P 500 jumped 2 1  as 440 plus stocks in the index moved higher  The Nasdaq Composite soared 2 7   and the Dow added 2 1  or 512 points  The indexes finished very close to their highs on the day 
Oil prices moved higher  as did grain prices on the news  Gold was steady 
The rally was helped by a modest decline in the U S  dollar  which had been attracting money from investors looking for a safe haven from the volatility caused by the U S  China trade war and a tariff dispute with Mexico over immigration 
In a Chicago speech  the Fed chief said the central bank is  closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U S  economic outlook and  as always  we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion  with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2  objective  
The market took off on that news  with traders assuming Powell meant the Fed would cut interest rates if necessary 
The speech showed Powell that he has a bully pulpit indeed  Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke made a similar promise during the 2011 budget showdown between Congress and President Barack Obama  and markets promptly reversed a summer long slump 
Ironically  Powell s speech pushed interest rates higher  as investors shed bonds for stocks  The key 10 year Treasury yield rose to 2 119  from Monday s 2 081  
There may discussion on rates going forward in the minutes when the Fed releases the minutes from its most recent meeting in Wednesday  The minutes from the April 30 May 1 meeting will be released at 11 a m  ET  20 00 GMT   The Fed has been holding its key federal funds rate at a range of 2 25  to 2 5   despite complaints from President Trump 
The rally was the biggest since Jan  4  That day  the Dow jumped 746 points  or 3 3   the S P 500 added 84 points  or 3 4   and the Nasdaq soared 275 points  or 4 3  
A total of 29 of the 30 Dow stocks gained on the day  led by  Nike   NYSE NKE   Dow  NYSE DOW  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL    Verizon Communications   NYSE VZ  was the only Dow decliner 
Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN   Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  and  American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL  were the leaders among Nasdaq 100 stocks  All had been slammed recently by the trade disputes  Only three stocks in the index were lower 
The weak areas of the market overall were interest rate sensitive stocks like real estate and utilities 
Tuesday s rally was so broad much of the buying decisions were computer generated  For evidence  look at the uniformity of the S P 500  Nasdaq and Dow gains  A trigger may have been that that the relative strength indexes of the major market indicators had fallen below 30 on Monday  An RSI under 30 is often a buy signal  In addition  the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 ended the day no longer in correction territory  defined as a 10  decline from a recent peak 
S P winners and losers
Mattel  NASDAQ MAT   Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN  and Xerox  NYSE XRX  were among the top performers in the S P 500 on Tuesday 
 Nektar Therapeutics   NASDAQ NKTR   Veritas  NYSE VTR  and HCP  NYSE HCP  were among the biggest S P 500 laggards ",2019-06-04,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stock--wall-street-surges-on-powells-promises-1888158,1888158
410012,COP,Exclusive  ConocoPhillips prepares to sell stake in Canada s Cenovus   sources,news,"By John Tilak  David French and Ernest Scheyder  Reuters    ConocoPhillips  N COP  is preparing to offload its stake in  Cenovus Energy  Inc  TO CVE   which it acquired as part of an asset sale to the Canadian oil and gas producer last year  people familiar with the matter told Reuters  The U S  energy company has held discussions with investment banks about appointing advisers to the sale and could offer the shares to institutional investors as early as this month  said the people  They cautioned that the precise timing would depend on market conditions and could change   If ConocoPhillips does not complete the sale in June or early July  it would then likely wait until September when institutional investors will have returned from their summer vacations  they added  The ConocoPhillips stake in Cenovus is worth C 2 6 billion   2 billion  based on its current share price but it would likely be sold at a small discount  the sources said  It would still be one of the biggest Canadian equity share sales this year  ConocoPhillips has been actively selling assets and cutting costs in the past two years in order to cull debt and boost its dividend  It sold  17 billion in assets in 2017   When Cenovus acquired oil sands and natural gas assets from ConocoPhillips for C 17 billion last year  it took 208 million shares of Cenovus  as well as C 14 1 billion of cash  The deal made ConocoPhillips the biggest investor in the Calgary  Alberta based company  although the U S  oil giant has said it would not be a long term holder of Cenovus equity  ConocoPhillips and Cenovus declined to comment  The sources declined to be identified as the information is not public  Shares of Cenovus extended their losses  to fall as much as 8 8 percent after the Reuters report  They closed down 5 7 percent at C 12 67 on Monday  The broader Canadian energy index was down 2 1 percent  Cenovus shares have had a wild ride since the acquisition  declining as investors punished the stock over the deal  which was regarded as significantly stretching the Canadian company s finances  While still down 27 percent since the deal was announced  they have been bouncing back of late on the back of an oil price  CLc1  rebound  The stock is up 24 percent in the last three months  The move follows a similar overnight stock sale by Royal Dutch Shell Plc  L RDSa   which last month sold its entire stake in  Canadian Natural Resources  Ltd  TO CNQ  for  3 3 billion  At the time of the 2017 deal  ConocoPhillips valued its Cenovus stake at  9 41 per share based on Cenovus  New York listed stock  Since the May 17  2017  transaction close  the share price has see sawed above and below that value  although it has consistently traded higher since April 25  While overnight trades tend to be discounted from current share price levels  in order to incentivize investors  Conoco would need Cenovus  value to be at a point where it is making money even after the discount to make the sale worthwhile  If the same 2 9 percent reduction was applied from Shell s overnight sale of Canadian Natural Resources shares  the Cenovus stock would need to be above  9 68 to generate a profit  Conoco has also moved aggressively to get cash in other areas  including by seizing international assets controlled by Venezuelan state controlled oil producer PDVSA   
Much of the fresh cash the company has raked in has gone back to shareholders  with the company s dividend up about 8 percent in the first quarter to 28 cents and a plan to buy back  2 billion in shares this year ",2018-06-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-conocophillips-prepares-to-sell-stake-in-canadas-cenovus--sources-1479453,1479453

274860,AAPL,Apple Roundup  China  IPhone Rumor  WWDC  Acquisitions,opinion,"June ended on a positive note for the market with the President relenting on the issue of Huawei and going back to the negotiating table with China  This is good for many technology companies including Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    which has from the beginning said that no good would come from the trade war 
CEO Tim Cook  along with other technology leaders have been meeting with the President and his advisory committee where they have promised to train an increasing number of Americans so the skill shortage wont force them to recruit from other places 
At the same time  Apple is considering moving part of its manufacturing out of China and preparing for antitrust lawsuits at home  Regulatory matters aside  June is always special because Apple hosts its developers  conference this month  which along with some acquisition news  rounds out the top stories 
Apple Moving Production Out of China
According to a Nikkei Asian Review report  Apple has asked its Chinese suppliers Foxconn  Pegatron  Wistron  MacBook maker Quanta Computer  iPad maker Compal Electronics and AirPods makers Inventec Corp  Luxshare ICT and Goertek to consider moving 15 30  of production out of China  The goal is to geographically diversify the supplier base so as not to be overly dependent on any particular country government 
Apple apparently specified that Mexico  India  Vietnam  Indonesia and Malaysia were preferred locations with India and Vietnam being favorites for smartphones 
Meanwhile  Young Liu Way  one of Foxconn s incoming directors  has said that around 25  of its production capacity is already located outside China and that there would be no difficulty responding to the demands of the U S  market 
CEO Tim Cook maintains that while people think that the iPhone is made in China  it s actually only assembled there and that the iPhone is actually built all over the world   And so a tariff on the iPhone would hurt all of those countries  but the one that would be hurt the most is this one   he said of the U S 
He has also said that he doesn t expect China to impose retaliatory tariffs that could hurt Apple   Well  currently  the Chinese have not targeted Apple at all  And I don t anticipate that happening  to be honest   according to CBS News 
Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  analysts estimate that the impact of Apple s China exposure is 29  of earnings as any loss of revenue is partially offset by reduction in operating cost 
Developers Sue Apple
After the Supreme Court okayed lawsuits against Apple regarding its dominance of the iOS app marketplace  some developers have sued the company for forcing them to sell via the app store 
Developers of basketball workout and baby naming apps were among entities complaining that Apple s policy of requiring sales only through the app store forced them to raise the prices of their apps  Apple s 30  commission for maintaining a relatively secure marketplace where they had to compete with 2 million other developers for visibility  is excessive according to them  and prevented them from making a profit 
Apple has denied that it s a monopoly because they can still make Android apps  but of course this is not the issue  It has also said that it charged a commission of only 1  of Spotify   NYSE SPOT   users  so the company shouldn t complain  Spotify is the one that first took the matter to European regulators   The monopolistic practices of technology companies have come under fire of late  so Apple s arguments may not stand up in court  It s dominance of the iOS marketplace may be short lived  Then again  it may succeed in keeping the matter in court indefinitely 
Developers  Update
The highlights of this year s WWDC included a brand new iPad OS and updates for watchOS  tvOS  iOS 13 and macOS  Here are some of the highlights 
The iPadOS interface is now a hybrid between macOS and iOS with enhanced Apple Pen support  upgraded Split View and Slide Over  a more powerful Files App  as well as a customizable home screen 
The iOS 13 preview showed a new Dark Mode for iOS  more comprehensive editing tools  a revamped Maps app with much greater accuracy despite being far more detailed  to launch later this year  and a more natural sounding Siri  There will also be a new encryption framework called CryptoKit that developers can use to  perform cryptographic operations securely and efficiently  in iOS applications  The promise is that the new OS will launch apps up to 2X as fast  with 30  improvement in Face ID unlocking speeds  a 50  drop in app download sizes and a 60  drop in app update sizes 
The completely voice controlled macOS Catalina launches this fall with improved iPad compatibility to Mac owners using models from mid 2012 or later  It allows iPads to be used as second displays  It replaces iTunes with standalone versions of the Apple Music  Apple Podcasts and Apple TV apps  It comes with Project Catalyst that helps iPad developers easily convert their apps into Mac apps 
The watchOS will launch this fall  bringing healthcare enhancements for women and the hearing impaired  The update is available for Apple Watch Series 1 devices or later paired with iPhone 6S or later and running iOS 13 or later  It s coming with the watchOS version of the App Store  complete with calculator  audiobook and voice recording apps 
The new tvOS  to launch in the fall of 2019  will have a new Apple TV home screen and multi user support for personalized experience to each user  It will also come with Xbox One and PlayStation 4 game controller support 
With a focus on privacy and security  Apple s new  Human Interface Guidelines  requires developers to place a  Sign in with Apple  option above the  Sign in with Google  or  Sign in with Facebook  buttons they provide in their apps  when they provide these options  
These buttons come in handy for users who don t want to bother with remembering separate sign in credentials for each app  But users don t always realize that linking all their activities to their Google or Facebook   NASDAQ FB   accounts enables these companies to use their data for profiling  ad targeting and developing artificial intelligence 
Apple proposes a more private sign in option that won t allow this to happen  Since users generally pick the default or the option placed right at the top  that s where Apple wants its button to be 
The guidelines aren t strictly mandatory but developers widely believe that compliance helps them get approved 
iPhone 11 Rumors
Veteran Apple analyst Ming Chi Kuo has forwarded the information that Apple is gearing up to launch 5 4 inch and 6 7 inch flagship iPhones in 2020  The lower cost version will also have a big screen size of 6 1 inches and an OLED display  The modem in all phones will come from Qualcomm but only the 5 4 inch and 6 7 inch versions will have 5G with the 6 1 inch version only offering LTE  Its own 5G modem will first be introduced in its flagship devices in 2022 or 2023 
Apple Interested in Intel s Modem Business
According to sources at The Information  Apple is looking to buy Intel s modem business  which is basically the wireless arm of the German technology firm Infineon that Intel   NASDAQ INTC   purchased in 2011 for  1 4 billion  This is the same unit that supplied baseband chips to Apple between 2007 and 2010  before it became part of Intel 
Intel has said publicly that after Apple patched up with Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM   and entered into a multi year licensing deal with the chipmaker  the modem business wasn t something the company could profitably pursue any more  So it has been looking for buyers 
The reason Apple is interested in Intel s unit is because of its ultimate goal of developing the 5G modem internally  As far as the Qualcomm truce is concerned  Apple was forced to eat humble pie after declaring that Qualcomm s licensing fees were extortionist and taking the chipmaker to court  Apple has the strategy of making as much of its devices in house as possible and has been building a semiconductor team for some time  The current deal is likely designed to buy it time until the technology is ready internally 
In February  Apple hired away Umashankar Thyagrajan from Intel  who is thought to have played a key role in the development of its XMM 8160 5G modem  that was being developed for Intel  but wasn t delivered on time  
Bought Drive ai
Some people were concerned that Apple was shuttering its self driving operations  or at least trimming it when it announced a headcount reduction of 200 in January  Apple put those fears to rest in June with the confirmation that it was buying struggling self driving shuttle service Drive ai  The company operates in Texas 
This is a standard aqui hire  with not much more to add  The company trimmed its own workforce by 90 before Apple acquired it  Apple being the giant that it is  doesn t need to report what it paid for the company  but Drive ai reportedly raised  77 million   
Unlike Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Waymo  Apple hasn t reported any major automotive partnerships and its own self driving technology doesn t receive the same amount of press  but comments by Tim Cook on various occasions indicate that it remains very much in the running  Talking about where it s going in the future is just something Apple has never done that well

326250,TGT,Euro zone Nov retail sales rise unexpectedly m m,news,"BRUSSELS  Jan 9  Reuters    Euro zone retail sales
unexpectedly increased in monthly terms in November and fell
less than forecast year on year  data showed on Friday in a rare
signal defying deep gloom in the recession hit economy 
 Retail sales in the then 15 country area grew by 0 6 percent
from October and shrank 1 5 percent annually    the sixth
straight yearly drop  European Union statistics office Eurostat
said 
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected November retail
trade to be flat month on month and down 1 6 percent on the
year 
 Eurostat revised down its October data to a 1 0 percent fall
on a monthly basis and a 2 3 percent decrease annually  compared
with previous readings of  0 8 percent and  2 1 percent 
 Retail sales are an indication of household demand  Falling
private consumption was one of the reasons for a shrinkage in
the euro zone economy in the second and third quarters 
 Economists expect a deeper recession for the fourth quarter
of 2008 and the first three months of this year  and expect the
European Central Bank to cut interest rates next week following
a fall in inflation to well below the bank s target 
 Economists had put some of the blame for weakening household
demand on high inflation  which peaked at 4 0 percent in July 
Inflation fell to 1 6 percent in December with a drop in oil
costs  compared with the ECB s target of just below 2 percent 
 Many analysts expect the bank to cut interest rates by 50
basis points to 2 0 percent to help kick start the economy  in

unemployment crept up

280990,AAPL,After bruising China battle  Uber cedes to rival Didi,news,"By Heather Somerville and Denny Thomas  Reuters    After a bruising two year battle  ride hailing firm Uber is selling its China operations to bigger local rival Didi Chuxing in a deal that will give Uber a one fifth stake in Didi  The merged entity is worth around  35 billion   combining Didi s most recent  28 billion valuation and Uber China s  7 billion worth   said a source familiar with the matter who did not want to be named before the deal was made public  Didi confirmed the agreement on its official microblog  but gave no valuation  In a posting on Uber s website  CEO Travis Kalanick said San Francisco based Uber Technologies would have a one fifth stake in Didi  making it the Chinese firm s biggest shareholder  Kalanick will join Didi s board  with Didi Chuxing chief Cheng Wei joining the Uber board  Uber will continue to operate independently  the Didi posting said   Cooperating with Uber will give the entire mobile travel industry a healthier order and a period of a higher level of development   it said  China has been a challenging market for Uber  which has spent billions of dollars in a price war with Didi  Both firms spent heavily to attract riders with discounts and both also raised billions in recent fundraisings  Uber is profitable in the United States  Canada and about 100 other cities  In an internal message to staff viewed by Reuters  Kalanick wrote   Sustainably serving China s cities  and the riders and drivers who live in them  is only possible with profitability  This merger paves the way for our team and Didi s to partner on an enormous mission  and it frees up substantial resources for bold initiatives focused on the future of cities   from self driving technology to the future of food and logistics   He said Uber was operating in more than 60 cities in China and  doing more than 150 million trips a month   Didi  however  claims 87 percent of the Chinese market for private vehicle ride hailing  Richard Ji  Hong Kong based co founder of All Stars Investment Ltd  which manages about  900 million and owns Didi stock  said the deal makes  huge sense    Uber faces an uphill task in China especially since Didi is multiple times larger by transaction value and city coverage   he said   This will lead to favorable outcomes for both companies  The biggest benefit is cost savings  they no longer have to give out subsidies to drivers and passengers  It will give pricing power as the new entity will become the dominant player  That means profitability will come sooner than later   Under the deal  Didi will also invest  1 billion in Uber  which operates globally outside China  the source said  adding to a series of deals and joint ventures Didi has struck in recent years  INTERNATIONAL AMBITION Analysts said Didi s acquisition signals its readiness to step beyond its home market   This clearly shows Didi s global ambitions and its desire to work together with Uber to tap Chinese travelers  who are going out in big numbers  There s a possibility the two could work together in other markets   All Stars Investment s Ji said  Didi said in its posting it will look to expand its international business and enter markets like Hong Kong  Taiwan  Macau  Japan  South Korea  Europe and Russia  Didi   itself created last year from a merger of two firms backed respectively by e commerce giant  Alibaba  Group  N BABA  and social network firm Tencent  HK 0700    has invested  100 million in Lyft  Uber s main rival in the United States  It has also formed an alliance with Lyft  India s ride service Ola and Southeast Asia s ride hailing startup Grab in an effort to compete with Uber s global dominance  The Didi deal is the latest sign that global Internet and technology companies are struggling to break into China s cut throat market  where local entrepreneurs have built formidable businesses  partly helped by a supportive government  All of China s technology heavyweights will be stakeholders in Didi  as Uber shareholder Baidu  O BIDU  will gain a stake  Apple Inc  O AAPL  recently made a rare  1 billion investment in Didi  China last week issued guidelines that establish a long awaited framework for the booming ride hailing industry and remove uncertainty for firms such as Didi and Uber  It was unclear whether the deal would need to be cleared by China s Ministry of Commerce  MOFCOM   the anti trust regulator  
 Given Didi s reported high market share  any increment would attract MOFCOM s attention  But for the parties to seek pre closing approval  each has to meet the minimum sales threshold  That s where it s unclear whether an anti trust filing would be required   said Marc Waha  partner at Norton Rose Fulbright ",2016-08-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/uber-to-combine-china-business-with-didi-chuxing-in-$35-billion-merger:-bloomberg-417688,417688

earnings surprise trend  having lagged estimates in 11 of the last 15 quarters  Moreover  it witnessed average negative earnings surprise of 28 1  in the trailing four quarters Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement How Are Estimates Faring The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings is pegged at 3 cents  indicating a significant growth from a loss of 3 cents incurred in the prior year quarter  Notably  the consensus mark has remained stable over the past 30 days  For quarterly revenues  the consensus mark stands at  1 23 billion  implying a decrease of roughly 8 9  from the prior year quarter s reported figure Avon Products  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Moreover  the consensus estimate for quarterly revenues in Europe  Middle East   Africa  South Latin America  and North Latin America segments stands at  440 million   444 million and  206 million  suggesting a decline of about 12 2   14  and 0 5   respectively  on a year over year basis  Conversely  the revenue estimate for the Asia Pacific segment is pegged at  119 million  reflecting 5 3  growth year over year Things You Should Know Ahead of Q2Avon  which is likely to be acquired by Natura  remains well on track with its  Open Up Avon  strategy  This is expected to drive the company s top and bottom lines in the to be reported quarter  The strategy focuses on reviving the company s direct selling business model  renovating the brand  enhancing e commerce and other capabilities to aid a performance driven transformation  Backed by the aforementioned initiative  the company also remains committed to attain its financial targets As part of this initiative  management expects to improve operating efficiency  slash inventory levels and reduce portfolio complexity by certain restructuring efforts  Restructuring actions include a 25  decrease in Stock Keeping Units  SKUs   a 15  reduction in inventory levels and a 10  job cuts  These jobs cuts are estimated to fetch Avon annualized pre tax savings of nearly  97 million by 2019 end  These efforts are likely to help the company simplify operations and generate higher cost savings  These cost saving initiatives should cushion Avon s bottom line in the upcoming quarters by aiding margins In addition  Avon remains committed to improve digital tools and e commerce channel to boost sales and Representative experience  Avon created dedicated e commerce business units in all key markets  which helped it to steadily increase sales through this channel  Management targets doubling e commerce sales in 2019  which should contribute to top line growth in quarters ahead However  Avon is grappling with soft Representatives growth for quite some time now  This has been hurting the company s top line  which lagged the consensus estimate in eight of the last 11 quarters  Moreover  the company s focus on boosting Representatives  morale via higher cost of investments in the form of training and increased promotions might hurt its margins and profitability Further  the company is reeling under adverse foreign currency translations  which are likely to persist in the second quarter  In fact  Avon witnessed continued pressures from currency in the last reported quarter  with significant impacts on sales  adjusted operating margin and earnings  Notably  the company s revenues in the first quarter included an 11  negative impact from foreign currency mainly due to currency devaluation in Brazil  Argentina and Turkey What Does the Zacks Model Say  Our proven model does not show that Avon is likely to

surge  as President Trump and his Chinese counterpart showed intention to resume bilateral trade talks as early as next week  Before the state heads meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka  Japan  high level officials are likely to set the ball rolling to pull bilateral ties away from brinkmanship that has dragged relations to its nadir The telecom industry has bore the brunt of the tariff war with various trade restrictions affecting the supply chain mechanism and risking the sustainability of businesses  While several U S  firms have appealed to the government to ease the trade embargoes  the global telecom industry has showed signs of massive disruption  The story is somewhat similar on the other side as well  with China telecom sector recording slower revenue growth as it continues to feel the pinch The trade negotiations between the two warring countries will aim to resolve these issues  In addition  experts widely view the change of stance as a possible ploy by Trump

256572,CEF,Stocks Versus Gold  3 Years On,opinion,"Chart 1  Three years ago  in August  11 Gold peaked and US stocks bottomed


 Source  Stock Charts  edited by Short Side of Long 
With only two weeks left in August 2014  I thought it was appropriate to revisit an interesting inflection point that occurred exactly three years ago  During August 2011  US default worries and the ongoing Eurozone Crisis sparked a panic sell off in the S P 500 and many other stock markets around the world 
Interestingly  Gold acted as a safe haven at the time  moving in an opposite correlation to global equities  refer to Chart 1   As the mini crisis played out by month s end  just about all traders   It was back during those market conditions that I initially  and  as well  while calling a potential bottom in the stock market  sentiment posts  and

Chart 2  Over the last three years Precious Metals have under performed

Source  Stock Charts  edited by Short Side of Long 
Three years have now passed and precious metals have dramatically under performed  while US equities have been the best major performing asset class  In Chart 2 we can clearly see what a powerful bull market the S P 500 has been in  posting gains of over 75  in the last three years  At the same time  the Central Fund of Canada ETF  ARCA CEF  which is 50  Gold and 50  Silver has pretty much halved in value 
Obviously  traders who focus on shorter term horizons and follow trends will not give this post all that much attention  However  investors who tend to chase out of  favour assets in a contrarian manner and purchase value at cheaper prices as longer term bets  should be looking at Chart 2 with an understanding that sooner rather than later  US equities will stop outperforming the overall global macro space  At that point  the question will arise as to where would some of the money flow towards  Which asset classes might next be favoured by liquidity 
Chart 3  Historically  the S P 500 rarely offers better returns over 3 years  

 Source  Short Side of Long
When we look at the 3 year holding investment history over the last five decades for both S P 500 and Gold  I could come to a plethora of observations  I m sure you could come up with many more  Right now  I will focus on what some investors are currently saying as the conventional wisdom 
Stock bulls  and there are an abundance of them  would claim that the US equity market has broken out to new highs  indicating the start of a new secular bull market such as the one in the 1980s  These same investors also claim that Gold s magic ten year period has now ended and the best case scenario for the yellow metal is to move sideways  like it did during 1980s and 1990s  
While I do not share the same enthusiasm toward stocks and pessimism toward Gold  I do admit that these investors could very easily be correct  Nevertheless  to them I say that rarely does the S P 500 offer better 3 year rolling returns then we have witnessed in the last few years  and at the same time rarely does the price of Gold offer such awful returns as we have witnessed in that same period 
Chart 4   while Gold rarely becomes more oversold then it currently is

 Source  Short Side of Long
To play devil s advocate  I could just as easily make a case that according to various valuation metrics  US stocks are currently very overvalued  Certain metrics even argue that future projected returns over the next several years and even up to a decade from now could very well be flat 
With that in mind  one could also make a strong case that the current sell off in Gold usually does not get too much worse relative to its historical periods of underperformance  In other words  while it is possible for price to go lower  the downside should be rather limited as this asset is already extremely oversold 
I also do not see a reason why one could not entertain the idea that the recent Gold sell off is just a correction within a secular bull market  with higher highs and higher lows still intact  If we study Chart 4 very closely  we should be able to notice that during the 1970s  Gold tripled in value twice over a three year rolling time frame  Now that is what a true bubble looks like  Even though Gold bears have called the recent 2011 peak a bubble  according to this historical chart it would not qualify as one ",2014-08-17,Tiho Brkan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-versus-gold:-3-years-on-222897,222897

422690,GILD,Gilead s  GILD  Harvoni And Descovy Get Approval In China ,opinion,"Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   announced that the National Medical Products Administration  NMPA  has approved its hepatitis C virus  HCV  drug  Harvoni  in China 
The drug has been approved for the treatment of HCV infection genotype 1 6 infection in adults and adolescents aged 12 18 years 
The approval should boost sales of the dwindling HCV franchise due to competitive pressure from the likes of AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   
Concurrently  Gilead announced that the NMPA has also approved Descovy  emtricitabine 200 mg tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg  F TAF   a fixed dose combination for the treatment of HIV  Descovy is approved in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV 1 in adults and adolescents  aged 12 years or older with at least 35 kg body weight   The therapy is already approved in the United States 
Gilead is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive product portfolio  The company was the first to bring to market a single tablet regimen  STR    Atripla   for the treatment of HIV  Additional STRs for HIV in the market include Complera Eviplera and Stribild  among others  TAF based products like Genvoya  Odefsey and Descovy are performing well with strong adoption both in the United States and Europe 
The company received a major boost when the FDA approved its once daily STR  Biktarvy  bictegravir 50mg emtricitabine 200mg tenofovir alafenamide 25mg  BIC FTC TAF  for HIV 1 infection  The approval  which comes ahead of the PDUFA date of Feb 12  2018  significantly boosts Gilead s HIV franchise  Biktarvy combines the novel  unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor   INSTI   bictegravir  with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of Descovy  FTC TAF   The approval of this new HIV therapy will pose stiff competition to GlaxoSmith s   NYSE GSK   existing therapies  Tivicay and Triumeq 
Gilead s stock has gained 0 9  in the past six months  worse than the s decline of 9 2  

 
Given the persistent decline in HCV sales  the company is looking to HIV and newer avenues to help the top line  The initial uptake of Yescarta  from the Kite Pharma acquisition  is slow but encouraging 
Moreover  Gilead has promising late stage candidates   selonsertib and filgotinib   in the NASH and inflammation markets  respectively  The company also has a collaboration agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ SGMO   to use Sangamo s zinc finger nuclease technology platform for the development of next generation ex vivo cell therapies in oncology

322490,TGT,Iamgold  Scotts Miracle Gro  Burlington Stores  Target And Dollar General Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 26  2017   Iamgold Corporation  NYSE        as the Bull of the Day  Scotts Miracle Gro  NYSE        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Burlington Stores Inc   NYSE         Target Corporation  NYSE TGT   NYSE        and Dollar General Corporation  NYSE DG   NYSE        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

	Your tech heavy portfolio probably needs a little bit of insurance and with the market bumping up against new highs now is a great time to add it Iamgold Corporation  NYSE        is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and carries a Growth Style Score of  A  which is just what I normally like to see  Let s take a look at why this is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in today s Bull of the Day 

	Insurance Play

	Maybe you have been riding the wave of higher tech stock prices over the last several weeks  Maybe you are seeing the run now take place in biotech names as well  And just maybe all that speculation in the market tells you that an insurance play for about 5  of your portfolio makes sense  This is just that sort of stock 

	Description

	IAMGOLD Corp is an international gold exploration and mining company based in Canada  It holds a 38  stake in the Sadiola Gold Mine and a 40  stake in the Yatela Gold Mine  Both are located in Mali  West Africa  Measured and indicated resources at Sadiola and Yatela are 5 5 million ounces of gold  including reserves of 5 2 million ounces   Inferred resources are 5 9 million ounces  IAMGOLD is actively exploring highly prospective ground in Africa and South America 

	Earnings

	The last four earnings reports have seen two beats and two meets  The beats  however  have been huge but most of that is due to the small base 

	Estimate Revisions

	Estimates for this year are moving in the right direction with the Zacks Consensus Estimate moving from a loss of about a nickel to a loss of two cents  Next year  the Zacks Consensus Estimate shows this company turning the corner into profitability  If we are still in this stock in 1Q18  it should lift considerably as it will be posting positive earnings 

	Valuation

	Without positive earnings  we do not have a PE ratio to fall back on  Instead  we have to look to the price to book and price to sales to get a better idea of where we stand  The price to book for this gold miner is 1 06x so the value minded investors have to like that  The price to sales multiple of 2 4x is also nice and low  The key here will be growth and can they deliver more than expected in terms of ounces  That is hard to know  but keep in mind that we are using this stock as a defensive tool as well

	It is officially summer and that means you are spending a little more time on your lawn and your flowers    or are you  A recent miss byScotts Miracle Gro  NYSE        makes me feel like the wetter than normal spring meant a slow start to planting season  Let s take a look at the recent quarter and what the expectations have adjusted to  When there is a miss like this  the negative revision to earnings estimates is the majority of the reason this stock slipped to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and is the Bear of the Day today 

	Recent Miss

	On May 2  the company posted earnings per share of  2 78  but that was  0 15 below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 93  That translates to a 5 1  negative earnings surprise 

	Description

	The Scotts Miracle Gro Company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  The Scotts Company LLC  is the world s largest marketer of branded consumer products for lawn and garden care  with products for professional horticulture as well  The Company s brands are the most recognized in the industry  In the U S   the Company s Scotts  Miracle Gro  Ortho and Smith   Hawken brands are market leading in their categories  as is the consumer Roundup brand  which is marketed in North America and most of Europe exclusively by Scotts and owned by Monsanto  NYSE MON   In the U S  the Company operates Scotts LawnService0  the second largest residential lawn care service business  In Europe  the Company s brands include Weedol  Pathclear  Evergreen  Levington  Miracle Gro  KB  Fertiligene and Substral  Its customers include home improvement centers  mass merchandisers  warehouse clubs  hardware chains  independent hardware stores  nurseries  food and drug stores  commercial nurseries and greenhouses  and specialty crop growers 

	Earnings

	The last four earnings reports have hit or miss  with the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate two times and missing the mark two times as well 

	Estimate Revisions

	Estimates for this year are moving in the wrong direction with the Zacks Consensus Estimate moving from  4 30 90 days ago to the current level of  4 14  The same can be said of the 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate which moved from  4 80 to  4 60 over the same time period 

	This move lower in earnings estimates is the key reason why this stock is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  as well as the reason for it being the Bear of the Day today

	These 3 Discount Stores are Booming Despite the Retail Slump

	As we are all aware the  sector is no longer a bed of roses  In fact  the sector has been struggling with soft store and mall traffic trends and a tough retail landscape  due to the change in consumer shopping preferences and the rise of competition with pure play eCommerce names like Amazon com Inc   NASDAQ AMZN  

	Not only this  the players in the sector have also been hit hard by major economic challenges like the strong U S  dollar  volatile commodity costs and global uncertainty  The volatility in U S  dollar for quite some time now has been hurting retailers with worldwide operations 

	This scenario has largely weighed on the performance of retailers  particularly Apparel and Department Stores  In a bid to stay in the rat race and be ahead of the curve  these retailers are heavily investing in building upon its eCommerce and omni channel functionalities  At the same time  they remain focused on optimizing store fleet and are eventually cutting down upon brick and mortar store counts  Also  these companies have taken up an aggressive remodeling of stores to attract traffic 

	Some retailers that are concentrating on optimizing store fleet include Macy s Inc   M  and American Eagle Outfitters Inc   NYSE AEO  and J  C  Penney Company Inc   JCP   Further  DICK S Sporting Goods Inc   DKS  also announced plans to bring a slowdown in its store growth plan 

	However  the game is still not over for this resilient sector  which is placed at the bottom 19  of the Zacks Sector Rank  13 out of 16   The sector still holds potential given the favorable economic indicators including decelerating unemployment rate and gradual housing market recovery  Apart from uplifting the economy  these factors play a key role in reviving consumer confidence that should improve consumer spending 

	Notably  the Retail Wholesale sector has outperformed the S P 500 year to date  The sector registered growth of 17  while the S P 500 index gained 9 2  

	While most industries under the Retail sector have been in the red  there is one industry that is booming   the Discount Stores  In such a volatile background  let s see what makes the Discount Stores stand out 

Why Discount Stores are Performing Well 

	Well  actually it is not surprising that the Discount Stores are doing well  Yes  the unique off price model of these stores makes it a favorite shopping place for today s value focused customers  particularly millennials  These stores offer attractive discounts  selling products at lower and reasonable prices when compared with traditional retail outlets  Further  these stores can easily adjust or slash price to react to a situation due to efficient distribution methods  This makes Discount Stores attractive destinations for customers in all economic scenarios 

	These factors have kept the Discount Store format shielded from the current turmoil in the retail segment  Notably  the  industry is at the top 38  of the Zacks Sector Rank  97 out of 256  

	This calls for investing in the Retail Discount Stores space  Here we have highlighted three Discount Stores stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  and a  of  A  or  B   These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals  surging share price and a track record of better than expected results 

	First on the list is Burlington Stores Inc   NYSE         with a long term earnings growth rate of 15 9  and a VGM Score of  A   The stock increased about 32 8  in the past one year  outperforming the Zacks categorized Retail Discount Stores industry that declined 8 3   This retailer of branded apparel delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 22 6  in the trailing four quarters and flaunts a Zacks Rank  2  You can see   

	Another lucrative option is Target Corporation  NYSE         which has a long term earnings growth rate of 5 4  and a VGM Score of  A   This general merchandise retailer delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 16 5  in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank  2  We note that in the last three months  the stock has declined 4 6   narrower than the Zacks categorized Retail Discount Stores industry s fall of 6 1  

	Investors can count on Dollar General Corporation  NYSE         a discount retailer providing various consumable products in the southern  southwestern  midwestern  and eastern U S  The stock has a long term earnings growth rate of 10 6   Further  the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 1 4  in the trailing four quarters and has a VGM Score of  A   In the last three months  this Zacks Rank  2 stock has exhibited a bullish run and advanced roughly 2 4   while the Zacks categorized Retail Discount Stores industry lost 6 1

333552,STZ,Is Constellation Brands Making a Big Mistake ,news,"Things weren t supposed to turn out this way for Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   The company s investment in Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC  was intended to generate strong growth while diversifying the company s business 
Unfortunately  Constellation Brands has seen loss after loss from the cannabis producer pull down its results  While some growing pains were inevitable  there s not much light at the end of the tunnel  Investing in the cannabis industry has been an expensive  4 billion bet for Constellation Brands  one that the company may want to consider walking away from sooner rather than later 
Another quarter weighed down by cannabis losses
Constellation Brands reported its third quarter earnings earlier this month  which offered no surprises for investors  Canopy Growth dragged down the company s results  yet again  Although Constellation reported a profit of  366 5 million in Q3  the beer maker still incurred a loss of  71 1 million relating to its investment in the Canadian cannabis company 
Unfortunately  this is not a new problem  as a lack of profitability has been a recurring issue for Canopy Growth  In July 2019  Canopy Growth fired co CEO Bruce Linton after another disappointing quarter dampened Constellation s numbers  The move rocked the industry and  even though Linton has since moved on  Canopy Growth continues to incur losses 

Over the past four quarters  the cannabis operator has accumulated net losses totaling 1 9 billion Canadian dollars on revenue of just CA 344 million  There s little hope of improvement around the corner as the company is bogged down in overhead and administrative costs  Selling  general and administrative costs totaled CA 241 million last quarter  which was more than triple the company s top line of CA 77 million 
There s a lot to fix at Canopy Growth  and what was initially an exciting investment in a new industry is looking like more and more like a burden on Constellation Brands 
Constellation is bullish on the Canadian marijuana market  but it shouldn t be
Despite the painful results  Constellation Brands isn t showing any signs that it s throwing in the towel on Canopy Growth anytime soon  The company s CEO Bill Newlands said   We remain bullish on the Canadian cannabis market as the conversion of the illicit market to the legal market continues to strengthen  
It s been more than a year since recreational pot use became legal in Canada on Oct  17  2018  but there s not a whole lot to be bullish about today  Data from Stats Canada suggests that less than one third of cannabis users buy pot from legal sources  Although that figure will likely rise as more cannabis stores pop up  legal pot prices are still far more expensive than what users can buy from the black market  Numbers from October indicate that illegal pot was nearly half the price of what consumers would pay from a licensed cannabis retailer  
The reality is that while there may be some improvements in the Canadian cannabis market with edibles and ingestibles now becoming available  that s not enough to make it an appealing market in which to invest  Cannabis research company BDS Analytics adjusted down its forecast for the cannabis industry in Canada last year from a projected market size of  5 9 billion by 2022 to only  5 2 billion by 2024 
That s not a terribly high number when you consider that Green Thumb Industries CEO Ben Kovler expects that the recently legalized Illinois market alone can be worth as much as  3 billion  The California market is already worth more than  3 billion  and that s with a very strong black market still jockeying for position there  
What does this mean for investors 
Constellation Brands isn t going to say it s dumping Canopy Growth because it s been a horrible investment  even if it really believes that  Doing so would only send the marijuana stock down even further in price  
Instead  the takeaway for investors is that Constellation Brands will keep seeing its numbers weighed down by Canopy Growth for the foreseeable future  as there s little hope of a drastic improvement happening anytime soon 
Another takeaway is for the broader cannabis industry  Companies from other industries may be more hesitant to get involved in the cannabis industry in Canada in light of the challenges that have plagued Constellation Brands since its big pot investment  That means investors shouldn t expect any big deals to happen anytime soon involving beverages or any other industries 
Canopy Growth may well turn things around  but it could take a very long time for that to happen  In the meantime  Constellation Brands  stock is likely to remain on a very turbulent path  and investors ought to steer clear of it for now ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plj7d,2065401

391062,NWSA,EUR USD Pokes At 1 3000 While Aussie Suffers,opinion,EUR USD is having a go at 1 3000 with little conviction while action elsewhere is generally uninspiring  though the aussie donned a pair of lead boots and went for a swim as today s weakest major currency   Today was about as close to a news free day as one could conjure up as I might as well more or less copy and past what I wrote yesterday  At that point  I said something like  if we get back and above 1 2900  it will mean we interact with 1 30  and all of that   and that s precisely what we got today  though it feels like the market has very little conviction on what it wants to do here   1 3000 may or may not fall  but let s have a look at the 1 3070 1 3170 zone if there is to be any real show of strength  In the longer term view  a EUR USD level of 1 3000 is remarkable indeed  One supposes that this rally is the last fumes of the  hooray  no EU tail risk  trade  or the opposite  in the eyes of those who have been caught short all through this   I suppose buyers are thinking   just wait  Spain will ask for a bailout ahead of at next week s EU summit and then we go to 1 3500   That may or may not unfold  but I have a hard time seeing how a Spanish bailout request changes anything beyond the shortest term  The mantra is this  the periphery must devalue  I assume that we won t see real debt restructuring  the Greek partial restructuring can t be a model for the rest of the periphery as the latter it is  too big   because that would be far too visionary and drastic for any identifiable politician in charge to consider at the moment Instead  the periphery will devalue in one of two ways   by leaving the EMU or re launching their old currencies alongside the euro and then redenominating their debt in their national currencies  this idea is absolutely nowhere in sight for now  it s just a thought experiment  OR we will see monstrous new ECB money printing to keep all debt zombie banks and debt zombie sovereigns afloat as we have thus far   Even if we do see the latter  which seems the likeliest course of action  if we continue to see the austerity debt deflation meme at the periphery  it will result in explosive social tensions  On that subject  the latest move in recent weeks is to ease off on the austerity message  something we are seeing in Britain  from the Fed  and now from the IMF  which is also urging the EU to take it easy on austerity  With less austerity pressure and no debt restructuring impetus  we all know what that will mean for the eternal scaling up of debt and money printing   Weak Aussie Interesting to note the broad weakness in the aussie despite the strong payrolls gain from Thursday  It is so far keeping the 1 0300 1 0335 zone in AUD USD intact that we have mentioned a great deal lately  As well  the gold price action hasn t been inspiring for the aussie  with every rally attempt over the last few days beaten back Looking ahead Watch out for G7 IMF statements over the weekend  particularly anything from the Japanese side on intervention  where we must remain on high alert after the recent USD JPY price action and levels and all of the rhetoric from the Japanese government    US presidential election warmup I recall from the presidential election before last  2004  how intolerably boring the market got at times during the summer leading into the event  But the market took off in mid October 2004  slashing out of the range with a vengeance before the results of the very close election were known  not that there was much at stake at the time   Greenspan was removing accommodation and the super bubble in US housing was in full swing as he promised gradual tightening  This time  there is a lot at stake  but the market isn t sure what the difference for the fiscal cliff will be depending on the winner of the US presidential election  as it appears Congress will be divided regardless  So now we wait for a move outside the 1 2800 1 3200 range in EUR USD and beyond 80 00 in USD JPY  assuming BoJ MoF corrals the pair if it tries below 77 50 or so  and beyond 1 0150 1 0000 in AUD USD  or even 1 0600 if the equity market rally suddenly reverts higher and slips into turbo mode   for a sign that  something bigger  may be unfolding here ,2012-10-14,Saxo Bank,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eur-usd-pokes-at-1.3000-while-aussie-suffers-139739,139739

391339,NWSA,AEterna Zentaris  A Falling Knife Worth Catching ,opinion,Starting in late August  with the initiation of a phase II trial for their flagship drug  AEterna Zentaris  NASDAQ  AEZS  saw a prolonged buying spree that I ll call  The September Rally   After The September Rally was set on fire by initiation of AEZS coverage by Roth Capital  with their very bullish price target of  1 75 share  trading got much more volatile We saw a particularly nasty drop on September 26th  when AEterna got discouraging news from the FDA about AEZS 130  A 1 6 reverse split announced by the company last Wednesday  October 3  2012  wrecked the shares again  and gains from The September Rally have disappeared  Before we analyze this  lets review AEterna Zentaris AEterna Zentaris is a   60 million biotech company that is very focused on the NDA for AEZS 130  which is their orally administered re agonist that is used as a diagnostic for Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency  AGHD   AEZS 130 is also undergoing trials as a therapeutic in cancer induced cachexia  although there will not be much attention on this program until phase II data comes out next year As of June 26  investors can view the company s finalized phase III data for AEZS 130 as a diagnostic product for AGHD here  The orally administered ghrelin agonist AEZS 130 wasn t actually put against the two main AGHD tests  insulin tolerance testing and arginine Growth hormone releasing hormone   but it the study demonstrated that AEZS 130 was quite well tolerated  Adverse events were limited to such things as  unpleasant taste  and diarrhea  which was rare   in only 3 8  of AGHD patients  AEterna Zentaris attempted to get fast track designation for their AEZS 130 NDA back in July  but received an unsurprising rejection two months later  AEterna still plans to submit the NDA in early 2013  but will not be reviewed on a rolling basis by the FDA due to the fast track rejection  This small setback seemed to upset AEZS shareholders immensely on September 26th  and the stock saw a 20  dive before the closing bell Those who have been following AEZS may also remember that the company received a delisting warning from NASDAQ in May  following a massive drop and subsequent decline in April due to the failure of perifosine   NASDAQ required that AEterna Zentaris would have to trade above  1 share for at least ten business days before November 12  2012 After the drop on September 26  which brought shares just above   60 apiece  the threat of a NASDAQ delisting was much bigger  In order to regain compliance  AEZS would need to rally around 70  or so by the start of November  With no catalysts on the horizon  this seemed quite improbable Although investors are now punishing AEZS for it  a reverse stock split was the only real option that the company had  Still  recent trading implies that the market sees the AEZS reverse split as a negative  Since the threat of a NASDAQ delisting is only possible after a 68  drop in current share price  using Friday s closing price of  3 09 share   AEterna Zentaris could issue new shares for tens of millions in extra cash before having to worry about sub  1 share again  Since the announcement of the reverse split  AEZS has dropped about 25   mostly from these concerns The market generally hates stocks that have undergone reverse splits  which implies that AEZS will be weighted down for quite some time  There is also surprisingly low short interest on AEZS  about 1 85  of float  which provides ample room for short sellers to jump in AEterna Zentaris has certainly been struggling since the failure of its former flagship compound perifosine  but maintains a   5 million quarter R D budget for its pipeline  The company also holds around  40 million in cash  as of June 30th   and does earn some royalty income from Cetrotide  which was licensed to Merck   While it operates at a loss of roughly  7 6 million quarter  AEterna Zentaris claims that it is undergoing cost cutting efforts that will reduce the cash burn rate  meaning a slower share dilution rate in the future if successful  We should also consider their phase II cancer drug AEZS 108  which was a big factor in Roth s bullish price target  AEZS 108 may garner much more attention from the market if the FDA grants it  Special Protocol Assessment  for Phase III trials in endometrial cancer  The company was supposed to submit its SPA request in September  which means that we ll see a letter from the FDA s review team within 45 days  meaning mid November at the latest  If Roth Capital s price target   10 50 share adjusting for the 1 6 reverse split  can be considered accurate at this point  AEZS should be trading as much as 240  higher  Then again  even if AEterna Zentaris could shrug off the recent damage caused by the FDA s rejection of fast track for AEZS 130 plus the strong negativity associated with the 1 6 reverse split  the stock would gain an easy 50   Should we be piling into AEZS then A Wall Street proverb says that a trader should  never try to catch a falling knife   which is an idea quite applicable to the AEZS situation  There s a lot of incentive to buy the stock for its growing value potential  but enough selling momentum to keep many traders waiting for AEZS shares to stabilize a bit  Since the AEZS 130 NDA shouldn t be submitted

347459,PXD,Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  Lags Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 18 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 40 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 22 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  15 71   A quarter ago  it was expected that this independent oil and gas company would post earnings of  1 69 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 07  delivering a surprise of 22 49  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Pioneer Natural Resources  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry  posted revenues of  2 68 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 84   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 53 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Pioneer Natural Resources shares have added about 7 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9 5  
What s Next for Pioneer Natural Resources 
While Pioneer Natural Resources has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Pioneer Natural Resources was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 69 on  2 27 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  7 89 on  9 70 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States is currently in the bottom 16  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-02-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pioneer-natural-resources-pxd-lags-q4-earnings-estimates-200387737,200387737
295115,TSLA,GM squeezes pounds and pennies to attack Ford s pickup profit machine,news,"By Joseph White
FORT WAYNE  Ind   Reuters    When General Motors Co  N GM  engineers were developing the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks  some of them joined public tours of  Ford Motor Co  s  N F  Dearborn  Michigan factory to watch aluminum bodied F series trucks go down the assembly line 
The redesign of the Ford F series trucks  launched in 2014  set a new standard for fuel economy and lightweight vehicle construction  But armed with stopwatches and trained eyes  the GM engineers believed they saw problems 
 They had a real hard time getting those doors to fit   Tim Herrick  the executive chief engineer for GM truck programs told Reuters 
His team did more intelligence gathering  They bought and tore apart Ford F series doors sold as repair parts  Their conclusion  GM could cut weight in its trucks for a lower cost using doors made of a combination of aluminum and high strength steel that could be thinner than standard steel  shaving off kilograms in the process 
These pounds and penny based decisions will have major implications in the highest stakes game going in Detroit  dominance in the world s most profitable vehicle market  the petrol fueled large pickup segment  What s more  GM is banking on strong sales of overhauled 2019 Silverados and GMC Sierras to fund its push into automated  electric vehicles   a business many investors see as the auto industry s long term future 
The risks are high given the hits automakers have taken from U S  President Donald Trump s trade policies 
Rising aluminum prices spurred by Trump s tariffs are driving up costs on the Ford s F series  while rising steel and aluminum prices drag on GM results  GM also has a significant risk should the United States  Mexico and Canada fail to agree on a new NAFTA trade deal  given GM trucks built at its Silao  Mexico factory could face a 25 percent tariff if NAFTA collapses 
Graphic  
Interviews with GM executives and a tour at its factory here in northwest Indiana provide a detailed look inside GM s plan for the most important vehicles in its global lineup 
These big pickups are everything Tesla Inc s  O TSLA  Model 3 or a Chevy Bolt electric car is not 
The mostly steel body is bolted to the truck s steel frame  rather than the one piece body and frame electric vehicles  The majority of trucks will have a V 8 gasoline engine in front powering the rear wheels   like the classic GM cars of the 1950s  Some Silverados will have new four cylinder engines  but there is no electric or hybrid offering as of now  The new Silverado   GM s top selling vehicle in the United States   is a technology achievement of a different kind 
It is taller and has a longer wheelbase than its beefy predecessor  which can help it more easily meet federal fuel efficiency rules  But it is 450 pounds lighter  and its V 8 engine achieves 23 mile per gallon on the highway that rivals smaller SUVs 
Wall Street investors give Tesla and its electric vehicles a higher value than GM s shares  GM is betting that its core customers in the American heartland will keep paying premium prices   27 percent of GM trucks sell for more than  55 000   for these vehicles capable of hauling a trailer by day and substituting for a luxury sedan by night 
Large pickups generate at least  17 000 a vehicle in pre tax profit for GM  the company has indicated in disclosures to investors  GM executives told Reuters that with the new trucks  GM will have a big cost advantage they can use to chop at Ford s leading market share 
 We think we have thousands of dollars advantage  over Ford  just in the aluminum costs  It s big   said Herrick during a walk through the Fort Wayne plant  which began shipping the new Silverados and Sierras late last month 
He said GM plans to use its Silverado cost advantage to put more safety or entertainment technology in the trucks  fund programs such as a promised fleet of electric cars and return money to shareholders 
At Ford  truck marketing manager Todd Eckert said the company plans to stick to its game plan  For 41 years  the F series trucks have been the best selling single model line in the United States  For the first half of this year  the F series line   which ranges from the light duty F 150 to medium duty commercial trucks   has a 59 000 vehicle lead over the combined Chevrolet and GMC large pickups 
 There s always been competition in this segment and there always will be   Eckert said 
Ford s purchasing director Hau Thai Tang at an investor conference on Wednesday called the F series pickup  one of our profit pillars   and said Ford plans to increase the share of its 2018 2022 product development budget allocated to trucks and commercial vehicles to 29 percent from 24 percent in its prior 2015 2019 plan 
Ford said it cuts costs by recycling about 20 millions pounds of aluminum scrap every month in its operations  enough to build about 37 000 F series bodies 
A LIGHT METAL DUEL
For decades  Ford and GM matched each other s moves closely and built trucks that were similar in design  technology and capability 
With the launch of GM s new trucks  the rivals  technology strategies have diverged 
Ford in 2014 launched a new generation of F series trucks with all aluminum body structures for its big pickup trucks  and challenged rivals to find a better way match the fuel efficiency and towing power achieved using the lightweight metal and turbo charged  six cylinder engines 
Rising pressure from the U S  government to slash carbon dioxide emissions made Ford s move look smart 
The debate within GM over whether to follow Ford s aluminum strategy  was a really hotly contested item for us   said Herrick  He recalled skeptical questions when he sought approval from GM s board for the billions of dollars required to launch the new Silverados at three factories 
 Son  it really costs this much to build all those trucks   the 58 year old executive recalled being asked by a member of the board 
Herrick  and Global Product Development chief Mark Reuss  said the shareholders  billions would be better spent on what they call a  multi material  strategy 
The new Silverado and Sierra got close to the Ford truck s weight using seven different grades of steel in the cab  aluminum hoods  door exterior panels and tailgates  Reuss pushed development of a novel carbon fiber plastic that will be molded to make load beds for certain high priced GMC models   and perhaps be used in different ways in future GM models  Reuss said 
Before GM s direction was clear  a supplier to Ford sent Reuss a box of the rivets his competitor was using to fasten the F series aluminum body panels together  anticipating he d be ordering them  too 
 They re still on my desk   Reuss said in an interview 
The combination of weight reduction and engine technology produces a rear wheel drive 2019 Silverado with a 5 3 liter V 8 and an eight speed automatic transmission that averages 17 miles per gallon in the city and 23 on the highway  with a combined rating of 19 miles per gallon  Different versions of the truck get different mileage ratings 
A Ford F 150 with a 3 5 liter turbo six cylinder and optional equipment that boosts the payload to about 3 230 pounds is rated at 17 miles per gallon in the city  21 on the highway and 19 combined  according to the government  An F 150 with a lighter payload rating of about 2 640 pounds is rated at 18 miles per gallon city  and 25 miles per gallon on the highway  according to the government  Chevrolet claims a payload of 2 190 pounds for a 2019 Silverado with a 5 3 liter engine and an eight speed transmission 
FOUR DOORS FOR PROFIT
In some crucial ways  GM is following Ford 
GM previously could not keep pace with demand for crew cab pickups   models with four  sedan style doors in the cab  Ford used its lead in crew cab design to develop luxury truck models  such as the F 450 Limited  that have sticker prices as high as  100 000 
Average selling prices in the segment are around  42 000 to  45 000   higher than the industry average 
GM has now dedicated two factories to building light duty pickups   in Fort Wayne and Silao  Mexico   which have the flexibility to build  darn near 100 percent crew cabs if we wanted   Herrick said 
The GMC marketing division  meanwhile  is putting more emphasis on its Denali luxury truck brand  while Chevrolet will market more luxurious versions of the Silverado such as the frontier themed High Country  which has leather seats and a Bose sound system  GM executives said they want to increase the company s share of trucks sold at prices above  55 000 from the current 27 percent 
John Bergstrom  who owns a multi brand network of dealerships based in Neenah  Wisconsin  said the new GM trucks should pull in buyers who currently don t drive a pickup 

 We didn t have the technology we needed   Bergstrom said  With the new truck   we ve got that  They almost magically figured out how to get fuel economy out of these things

272259,AAPL,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s the three things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Apple Still in Focus
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  will likely be in the spotlight on Wednesday after it unveiled three new iPhones and said it s streaming service Apple TV  would be launched on Nov  1  at a lower price than rival streaming services  
The three models that will ship Sept  20 include the base iPhone 11  starting at  699  the iPhone 11 pro  starting at  999 and iPhone Pro Max  starting at  1 099  The flagship iPhone Pro Max looks similar to its predecessor  the iPhone XS Max  but features a triple lens camera on the back and five hours more battery life  
In a further effort to ramp up its services business to lessen its dependence on iPhone sales  which accounts for the bulk of overall revenue  Apple also announced its video game service  Apple  Arcade  It will be available in the App Store from Sept  19 at  4 99 a month  
Apple is up about 36  for the year so far  
2  Wholesale Inflation Data 
Wholesale inflation figures arrive Wednesday  a day ahead of U S  consumer prices 
The Labor Department will issue the producer price index  PPI  report at 8 30 AM ET  12 30 GMT   On average  economists expect that the PPI rose 0 1  last month  with the core PPI  which excludes volatile food and energy prices  rising 0 2   according to forecasts compiled by Investing com 
That would bring year over year PPI growth to 1 7  and core PPI growth up 2 2  
The PPI is considered a leading indicator  measuring the input prices for goods sold at a retail level 
3  U S  Oil Inventories  OPEC Monthly Report Due
Oil markets are set for a big Wednesday  with the release of the OPEC monthly report and the Energy Information Administration s  EIA  petroleum inventories for the week  
The OPEC monthly report will provide investors with an update on the cartel s outlook on world demand and supply at a time when investor expectations are running high that OPEC and its allies will continue to cut production  
The EIA report due at 10 30 AM ET  14 30 GMT  is expected to show a draw in crude stockpiles of 2 6 million barrels for the week ended Sept  6

298570,MSFT,Gates May Leave As Microsoft  MSFT  Chairman When Firms Taps New CEO  Report ,news,"By    By Nadia Damouni and Bill Rigby
NEW YORK SEATTLE  Reuters    Microsoft Corp  NASDAQ MSFT  is likely to appoint its cloud computing head  Satya Nadella  as its next chief executive  a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday  as the board concludes a five month search for a tech savvy heavy hitter to lead the world s largest software company    As part of the move  co founder Bill Gates may step aside as chairman and be replaced by lead independent director John Thompson  said the source  speaking on condition of anonymity because the process is private  Gates would remain a director  the source added    Bloomberg first reported the news on Thursday    Rising star Nadella  a native of Hyderabad  India   where Microsoft has its largest non U S  research center   was promoted to run the company s fast expanding cloud  or internet based  computing initiatives in July last year as part of current CEO Steve Ballmer s radical re organization of the company    The appointment of the 22 year Microsoft veteran would make him the most powerful Indian born tech executive in the world and put him alongside PepsiCo Inc s chief  Indra Nooyi  as the leader of a well known  large cap U S  corporation    Born in 1967 and educated in India and the United States  Nadella s tech career started at internet software pioneer Sun Microsystems  He joined Microsoft in 1992 and quickly climbed the corporate ladder with leading roles in the Office and Bing search engine teams    He was promoted to run the company s server and tools unit in 2011  That unit now forms the backbone of Microsoft s cloud computing platform  which Nadella runs under his official title of executive vice president  cloud and enterprise     He s a solid choice   offering continuity of strategy and proven execution  said Sid Parakh  an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen    Some investors had campaigned for an external CEO who might be more likely to shake up the company and reward shareholders with greater dividends and share buybacks  but Parakh said that did not mean Nadella would be unpopular with Wall Street     Any new CEO is going to have to have the shareholders  say in mind  But it s not certain that will translate into actions   said Parakh    If Nadella is named CEO  it is likely Thompson will help out on the crucial task of managing Microsoft s relations with its powerful Wall Street investors  the source said    Nadella has little experience of that aspect of the job  and Ballmer and Gates did not prioritize it  Gates would likely focus on technical innovation in any new role  the source said    There have been calls for months for Gates to step down from investors who believe Microsoft s co founder is a block to radical change and investor friendly moves    Ballmer  who plans to retire as soon as a new CEO is named  was reelected to the board in November  but it is not clear how long he will remain there after retirement  the source said    Several people briefed on the CEO search process had previously told Reuters that Microsoft was down to a handful of candidates  including Nadella and Tony Bates  executive vice president of business development  plus at least one external candidate    The board still has not met to finalize Nadella s offer and nothing has been signed  the source said  Microsoft declined to comment    Microsoft shares rose 0 8 percent to  37 15 after hours  after gaining slightly in regular Nasdaq trading    LONG SEARCH   Microsoft s CEO search has taken longer than most expected when Ballmer said last August he would retire within a year    In a blog post on the company s website in December  Thompson emphasized the need for a CEO with  an ability to lead a highly technical organization and work with top technical talent     Thompson  who leads the four member CEO search committee  said at the time he expected the panel to reach a decision  in the early part of 2014     The appointment of a company veteran like Nadella  which follows a flirtation with outsiders such as Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Alan Mulally  could disappoint some investors who want a more radical transformation at the software giant     While many on the Street are now expecting Mr  Nadella to get the CEO spot  we believe filling this position with a core Microsoft insider will disappoint those hoping for a fresh strategic approach  e g  potential breakup of enterprise consumer  Xbox spin off  an outside executive could have brought to the table   FBR analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note  adding that innovation and fresh strategies were needed     With that said  we believe Mr  Nadella s prior roles in the Online Services Division  Business Division and most recently as president of the Server and Tools business position him as a strong internal candidate with a broad set of knowledge around Microsoft s massive product portfolio   Ives wrote     Reporting by Bill Rigby  Editing by Bernard Orr and Andrew Hay ",2014-01-31,International

345792,SEE,Sealed Air  SEE  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Sealed Air  SEE  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 57 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 13 billion  down 0  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 57  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sealed Air 
For Sealed Air  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 15  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sealed Air will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Sealed Air would post earnings of  0 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 75  delivering a surprise of  11 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Sealed Air doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sealed-air-see-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200410209,200410209
330218,BLK,US Investment And Financial Services Stocks And Their Current Health,opinion,"The broader US index S P 500 gained 0 72 per cent on Tuesday to a close at 2818 points  The broader index does not show any clear trend on Investtech s medium term graph  but is inside a rising trend channel in the long term  which is one to six quarters 
Since establishing a bottom at 2351 points just before Christmas  the index has risen by almost 20 percent as of date and is just a little shy of its all time high of 2930 points on closing basis  which does not seem too far and only four percent away from Tuesday s close  Keeping our fingers crossed  if we can say that 
On the charts  the stock price of some of the big Financial Services stocks are doing really well  like Visa Inc  NYSE V    PayPal  NASDAQ PYPL  and Mastercard  NYSE MA   They are currently trading at their peaks  However  the other big commercial and banking services  investment and asset management stocks like Citigroup  NYSE C   JP Morgan Chase  NYSE JPM   Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  and Blackrock  NYSE BLK   to name a few  are not moving in tandem 
As per theory  the stock price cashes in all the available market information and reflects a company s health almost six months in advance  A stock price is nothing but a negotiation between demand and supply that the market players agree to pay for each share traded in the secondary market  So what does the price of a few of these stocks suggest 
Visa Inc   Close  155 30
Visa shows strong development within a rising trend channel in the medium to long term  Rising trends indicate that the company experiences positive development and that buy interest among investors is increasing  The stock has broken up through resistance at 151  This predicts a further rise  In case of negative reactions  there will now be support at 151 and 142 dollars 
Positive volume balance indicates that volume is high on days with rising prices and low on days with falling prices  which strengthens the stock  The stock is overall assessed as technically positive for the medium term 
Investtech s outlook  one to six months   Positive
PayPal Holdings  NASDAQ PYPL    Close  103 15
PayPal Holdings has broken up through the ceiling of the rising trend channel in the medium term  Based on the research that we have done in the Scandinavian markets  this kind of breakout signals an even stronger rising rate  This may or may not apply to US stocks 
The price has risen strongly since positive signals from two rectangle formations in the last 15 months  The objective at 98 43 dollars from the last rectangle is now met  but the formation still gives a signal in the same direction  The stock is in all time high  hence it can rise further  However  in case of a downward reaction  there is support between 99 and 90 dollars in the short term  The stock is overall assessed as technically positive for the medium long term 
The positive development  however  may give rise to short term corrections down from today s level  Hence one must maintain proper stoploss as per your preferred time frame 
Investtech s outlook  one to six months   Positive
Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Close  41 88
The Morgan Stanley stock is inside a falling trend channel both in the medium and long term  The stock fell more than 37 per cent in 2018 before making a low in December  In the last three months  the stock has attempted to cross the resistance at 44 dollars  but so far has not been able to sustain above it  To achieve a change in trend  the stock has to make higher tops and higher bottoms and close above the 46 80 mark  Until then it is in a weak zone 
The volume balance indicator is negative  suggesting that sellers are more aggressive with falling prices  while buyers are more passive when the price corrects upwards  There is support around 40 dollars and below that all the way to 37 dollars  which was also the stock s last major low 
Investtech s outlook  one to six months   Weak Negative
Citigroup  NYSE C    Close  61 22
Citigroup Inc is inside a falling trend channel in the medium term  but unlike Morgan Stanley it is inside an upward trend channel in the long term  Falling trends indicate that the company experiences negative development and falling buy interest among investors 
The stock corrected sharply after making a low of 49 26 dollars  but failed an attempt to move beyond 66 dollars  It has also given a breakdown from a small rectangle formation in the short term  Further downside is anticipated 
The stock is closer to its long term support around 60 dollars  If the price breaks below that  then the support is around 56 and 49 levels  Resistance at 65 60 and 72 50 dollars respectively 
Investtech s outlook  one to six months   Weak NegativeWe see that there is mixed behaviour among banking and financial services  investment and asset management stocks  You can study charts and auto analysis of all such stocks for the short  medium and long term time frames on our website at

Per the Journal  these moves mark Wells Fargo s efforts to convince regulators of the progress made in bolstering the internal control systems  shortcoming in which led to the series of scandals that came into light after September 2016 
In its latest quarterly filing  Wells Fargo revealed that it has wrongly foreclosed homes of more people than was previously disclosed  Having conducted a review for longer period  Mar 15  2010   Apr 30  2018   the company found that in about 545 cases loan modification was denied to eligible customers due to technical error  following which  foreclosure was completed 
Wells Fargo has a long list of ongoing probes that continue to impact its reputation  One of the enquiries being conducted on the bank s several operations is related to consumer deposit accounts  The consumer financial protection bureau is investigating whether customers were wronged by Wells Fargo s procedures related to freezing of consumer deposit accounts after it detected suspected fraudulent activity that affected those accounts 
One of the goals in the company s 2019 priority list is to enhance compliance and operational risk management systems along with timely remediation practices  Also  Wells Fargo is spending more on technology so as to ensure better data management and cybersecurity  These activities  along with close supervision of regulatory authorities  might help Wells Fargo move past the scandals and make way for growth

406270,GS,Fed clambers back to positive real rates  now debate is when to stop,news,"By Howard Schneider WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Federal Reserve will likely raise its target interest rate to above the rate of inflation for the first time in a decade next week  igniting a new debate  when to stop   The Fed has been gradually hiking rates since late 2015 with little sign of tighter conditions hampering economic recovery  The expected June increase will raise the stakes as the Fed seeks to sustain the second longest U S  expansion on record while continuing to edge rates higher   With inflation still tame  policymakers are aiming for a  neutral  rate that neither slows nor speeds economic growth  But estimates of neutral are imprecise  and as interest rates top inflation and enter positive  real  territory  analysts feel the Fed is at higher risk of going too far and actually crimping the recovery   The Fed is  gradually entering a new world when rates are at 2 percent   nearing zero on a real basis and approaching where they are no longer felt to be stimulating economic activity  said Thomas Costerg  senior U S  economist at Pictet Wealth Management   The last time rates moved into positive real territory on a sustained basis was the spring of 2005 when the Fed began tightening rapidly after a period of arguably too lax monetary policy  ending just months before the start of the 2007 2009 financial crisis   The debate over the current cycle s end point  came earlier than I expected   Costerg said  with the Fed facing imminent calls on where the neutral rate of interest lies   After the expected June increase the Fed s target interest rate will be set at a range of between 1 75 percent and 2 percent  matching the Fed s inflation target and roughly in line with the latest inflation data  That translates to a real rate of roughly zero and is already at neutral  according to some policymakers who feel the Fed should stop hiking now   To view a graphic on U S  interest rates and inflation  click  PLOTTING A NEW PATH  Along with a policy statement the June 12 13 Federal Open Market Committee meeting is due to be followed by a news conference by Fed Chair Jerome Powell   Updated economic projections will show whether policymakers still anticipate one additional rate hike in 2018  following June s  or if they now envision two increases  Longer run forecasts and possible changes to the language of the FOMC statement will shed light on the Fed s new phase  For much of the recovery from the financial crisis and recession  the statement has been used to reassure the public and investors that rates would remain  accommodative  and bolster chances of encouraging above trend growth  With rates closer to a neutral  non accommodative level  the communication challenge for the Fed is to flag the approach of a neutral rate of interest without signaling plans to make policy restrictive   This part of an evolution  of both our policy  given how well the economy is doing     but also just an evolution of communicating as our economy progresses     How we talk about it will naturally just evolve   San Francisco Federal Reserve bank president John Williams said in an interview with Reuters on Friday    When exactly that happens and how that happens  that s a decision for the committee   Williams will take over soon as head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  effectively the Fed s second most powerful post and key to communicating monetary policy to Wall Street  Policymakers  long run estimates of the real neutral rate of interest vary from 0 percent to 1 5 percent   The median estimate of the long run neutral rate is 0 9 percent  basically room for four more rate increases after June before policy risks becoming restrictive   Though a core of Fed officials feel rates on a shorter term basis may have to move slightly higher than that sometime in 2020 to keep inflation in check  only two see real rates above 2 percent in the foreseeable future   Some analysts argue the Fed need not worry about rates nearing neutral as long as jobs numbers stay strong and inflation remains near target  While Fed econometric models may point to a low neutral rate of interest   in the world of actual rate decisions  the key issue is the observable behavior of the economy and financial conditions   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  economist Jan Hatzius wrote recently

248548,HOV,Company Notes Digest  Housing Demand Continues To Be Weak,opinion,"The Macro Outlook
Toll Brothers concedes that they re disappointed by how housing has done this year
 Looking back at the last year and thinking about the growth that we saw in 2013 and how deep and dark and long this last housing depression was  we thought the pent up demand would continue to build and 2014 would be a significantly better year than 2013  And I think if you ask any CEO of any of the big public  they would tell you the same thing  So are we disappointed in flat or slightly negative order growth  The honest answer is yes    Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL  
Traffic was strong though  indicating that there might be interest in housing from a broader group of consumers
 We are encouraged by our traffic This pattern has continued into August with traffic up 19  per community versus last August  it s an indication that the whole market is playing with housing again  not just the exclusive those who can afford it and are not trapped in the homes that they re in    TOL 
Housing demand continues to be weak because prices are high and income growth is low
 Without real urgency pushing buyers to make a decision  general industry demand continues to be impacted by uncertainty about the economy and world events  improving but fragile consumer confidence and reduced affordability due to rising prices and limited personal income growth    TOL 
But demographics will eventually take over
 Millennials are going to the point where they too will become homeowners  and there are a lot of them  At the same time  the baby boomers are looking for that move down home  since they are becoming empty nesters with different needs    Hovnanian Enterprises Inc  NYSE HOV  
 The current low level of housing formations is not consistent with the population growth or the demographics of our country    HOV 
And mortgage underwriters are slowly starting to take a little more risk
 We have seen some green shoots and some good news on the self employed front  We re actually seeing people come out with products targeted to self employed people and no verification of income loans with 30  down and good credit scores  But instead of just not looking at the borrower at all  they re looking at cash flows  It will take 12 months  worth of bank statements to ensure that the person really has the cash flow regardless of their tax return  So I think that s really good news  and frankly I think it s prudent   TOL 
 the third party mortgage companies are hungry for deals  and they have been very competitive on rates  and that s causing some competition    HOV 
Don t forget  we have a midterm election coming up in November
 The election hasn t come to the front of the brain yet  But it s getting there and I wouldn t be surprised as we come closer to the election that we start to focus on the great number of things  There will a lot of promises made for sure    TOL 
Emerging markets may have slowed  but they re still growing faster than the developed world
 The developing world  an area where there is a lot of discussion  Overall  the markets are still vibrant  If you look at the macros  while slowing  they still outpace obviously the developed world    Crude Oil 
Just because emerging markets are growing doesn t mean it s easy to make money in them
 We had stores in China  We started with 12 back in 2006  We shut that business down and don t have any plans of going back  We couldn t figure out how to make any money in China   Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD

Consumer
At Barclays  back to school conference  a lot of CPG companies hit on common themes
 The rise of millennials  The influence of ethnic demographics  social media  the move towards healthier eating  and the rise of the middle class consumer in emerging markets   McCormick   Company Incorporated  NYSE MKC  
The  strapped consumer  is one of Kraft s key consumer groups
 Today  the strapped consumer represents 6 in 10 households  6 in 10 households earn less than 50 000 a year  Now if you are a single individual  living on 50 000 a year  that might be doable  But when you think about a family trying to feed four or five or six different people on that income  it becomes a challenge    Kraft Foods Group Inc  NASDAQ KRFT  
Millennials love to cook
 Today s millennials love to cook with 64  making this statement versus 52  of the remaining U S  population   MKC 
Whitewave did a good job of summarizing the healthier eating movement
 People look for quality ingredients  transparency and brands that they can trust  As consumers give more and more thought to the food choices they make for a healthy lifestyle  our brands meet their growing preferences for foods that are nutritious  great tasting  convenient  and responsibly produced    Whitewave Foods Company  NYSE WWAV  
Kraft s  agile marketing  strategy revolves around data and  shareworthy  content
 to win with agile marketing  First  it s data  it s the who  You need a significant set of consumers  and you ve got to know these consumers in depth  You ve got to know their behaviors  their preferences  You have to know their needs The next part of it in terms of agile marketing is content  And it s building content that is share worthy    KRFT 
Colgate is focused on leveraging its data too
 an area that I have talked about before which drives innovation is analytics  and we believe that analytics is a competence for the 21st century  We have the data  The question is  how do you aggregate it  cleanse it  interrogate it and use it quickly to drive action either in the development of innovation or the execution of programs behind innovation around the world    CL 
Technology
Laptops are going to have more 3G and LTE connections built in
 Whether it s Bluetooth or Wi Fi or 3G or LTE  things like Bingbooks and Chromebooks are going to be more and more connected  in fact they re really only functional or highly functional when they re connected  We think 25  to 50  of those over the next few years will have 3G or LTE connections    Intel Corporation  NASDAQ INTC  
Moore s law isn t dead
 In my 32 years at Intel I think I ve seen the death of Moore s Law at least four or five times  The first time I remember it was at about three micron and about one micron I remember it was going to die I am always amazed at our ability to innovate and find new ways to keep Moore s Law alive  We are shipping 14 nanometer product now  We have a path we believe to 10 nanometers and we know how to make 10 nanometers still stay on that in Moore s Law   INTC 
Internet of things is going to drive even more data center growth
 I am personally excited about them as technologies and as innovation area  But also they re fuel  they re grain of the data center  They are going to fuel billions and billions of pieces of information up into the data center that will then require more and more data centers to be built    INTC 
HCA gives an example of how it s using big data to optimize care in its hospitals
 For example  in terms of hospital acquired infections  you see a particular facility that s excelling at reducing hospital acquired infections  Well what are they doing  What are their protocols  What are their approaches  And then sitting down with physicians and other hospitals that may not have that sort of performance and showing them the data and moving them closer  if not into the best practices range  So that s just one example  kind of benchmarking sort of techniques    HCA Holdings Inc  NYSE HCA  
Healthcare
Large not for profit hospitals are focused on creating integrated healthcare networks
 Some of the large  not for  profit competitors in the market spend more time  I guess  thinking about maybe narrow networks  more in terms of physician strategies in terms of clinical integrated networks   HCA 
The trend of hospitals directly employing doctors may be slowing down a little though
 Physician employment continues to increase although at a much lower rate than we were seeing probably five  six years ago quite frankly  when you think about HCA and our physician relationships  we have  I mentioned  35 000 active physicians on our medical staff  And so we can t employ all those physicians   HCA 
If you re not employing doctors directly  you have to create facilities that they want to work at
 what we re looking at is  how do we make our facilities the place that they want to work  If they re a surgeon or they re a physician that would perform their services within the walls of our hospital  how do we make our facility the best facility for them    HCA

397757,SO,Explainer  UAE military drawdown raises stakes in south Yemen,news,"By Ghaida Ghantous
DUBAI  Reuters    Attacks on Yemeni forces that form a core component of the Saudi led military coalition in the south of the country risk further destabilizing Aden  seat of the government  and complicating United Nations peace efforts 
The Iran aligned Houthi movement  which the alliance has been battling for more than four years  launched a missile attack on United Arab Emirates backed Security Belt forces in the southern port city  a coalition stronghold  that killed 36 soldiers on Thursday 
The strike on a military parade was the worst violence to hit Aden since southern separatists forces  including Security Belt units  clashed with the Saudi backed government of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in 2017 in a power struggle 
Analysts say the Houthis may be testing any weaknesses in the coalition following the UAE military drawdown in the south and western coast announced in June  which appears to have also emboldened Islamist militant groups in Yemen who carried out separate deadly attacks on southern forces last week 
WHY IS ADEN SIGNIFICANT 
The Houthis have stepped up missile and drone attacks on Saudi cities  but this is the first serious attack by the group on Aden since it was captured by the coalition in 2015 
The Western backed  Sunni Muslim alliance intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis after they ousted Hadi s government from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014 
The Houthis  who hold most urban centers including Sanaa and the main port of Hodeidah  have no traction in the south  where the UAE has armed and trained some 90 000 Yemeni troops drawn from southern separatists and coastal plains fighters 
The Houthis appear to be testing dynamics on the ground after the UAE withdrew some troops and hardware from the area  the only territory seized by the coalition in the war and where Saudi Arabia holds less sway 
 There seems to be an attempt to test where and how the balance of power can shift   said Elizabeth Dickinson of the International Crisis Group think tank 
The attacks on southern security forces are also likely to heighten tensions between southern separatists and Hadi s government over who should control southern Yemen 
The war has revived old strains between north and south Yemen  formerly separate countries that united into a single state in 1990 under slain former President Ali Abdullah Saleh 
The Southern  NYSE SO  Transitional Council blames Hadi s government for the area s security and economic woes and has instigated protests in the past  Adding to tensions  southern forces were hit in two attacks within two days claimed by Islamic State and al Qaeda  among Yemen s many destabilizing forces 
The Council on Thursday called for restraint following the parade attack  which killed a Security Belt commander who was a leader among southern separatists  after many of its followers took to social media to threaten northerners in Aden 
WHY IS THE UAE SCALING DOWN ITS PRESENCE 
There are many reasons  war fatigue  Western criticism and rising Iran tensions that pose a risk closer to home 
Abu Dhabi says its decision has been in the making for months and was a natural progression after a ceasefire went into effect last December in Hodeidah  which became the focus of the war last year when the coalition tried to seize it 
Diplomats say the UAE accepted there could be no military solution due to global criticism of coalition air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians and a humanitarian crisis that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine 
Pressure by Western allies  including those that supply arms and intelligence to the coalition  to end the war that has killed tens of thousands  and heightened U S  Iran tensions  which risk triggering a direct confrontation in the Gulf  added impetus to the UAE decision 
A senior Emirati official said the UAE remained part of the coalition and would not leave a vacuum in Yemen as it continues to back the local forces it has built up to combat the Houthis and Islamist militant groups 
Diplomats have said Abu Dhabi s move is building momentum for a U N  sponsored nationwide truce in the Arabian Peninsula nation this year  but that this would require a de escalation of tensions between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia 
WHERE DO PEACE EFFORTS STAND 
Seven months on from the Stockholm pact  there has only been a unilateral Houthi withdrawal from Hodeidah ports  It has yet to be matched with a redeployment of coalition backed forces that would pave the way for a full pullout by both sides 
U N  envoy Martin Griffiths is shuttling between Yemen  Saudi Arabia and the UAE to salvage the deal  the first major breakthrough in peace efforts in over four years and a gateway to launching talks on a political framework to end the war 
A major sticking point in the Sweden pact remains agreeing on who would ultimately control Hodeidah amid deep mistrust among all parties  The port handles the bulk of Yemen s commercial and aid supplies and is critical for feeding the long impoverished country s 30 million population 
If broader political talks on a transitional ruling body materialize they would have to include Yemen s fractious parties  including southern separatists ",2019-08-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/explainer-uae-military-drawdown-raises-stakes-in-south-yemen-1945405,1945405

255097,MGA,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow  
1  Consumer in Focus
The economic calendar winds down on the final trading day of the week with another update on the U S  consumer from the University of Michigan 
The University of Michigan s preliminary November consumer sentiment index  due at 10 00 am ET  is forecast to show a reading of 95 9  up slightly from the last month s reading of 95 5  while consumer expectations data will also be in focus 
With the holidays not far away  the U S  consumer  the backbone of the economic growth this year  is set to come under increased scrutiny 
2  Oil Rig Count Rolls In
Traders will look to the latest rig count data due Friday for insight into whether U S  producers continue to relentlessly pump out millions of barrels of oil 
Data last week showed the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the U S  fell by 8 to 822  The count was also down nearly 23  from a year ago 
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand 
Fears that a slowing global economy  buffeted by trade tensions  would keep a lid on oil demand has been a big factor limiting upside in oil prices   
But with the U S  and China inching ever closer to a trade deal  those fears have receded slightly  helping crude prices find their footing 
3  Magna Earnings Puts Autos in Focus
  Magna International    NYSE MGA   suppier of mobility technology to the automative industry  reports earnings before the opening bell 
The auto supplier s earnings will also be closely parsed at a time when a slowing global economy has stifled demand for autos  keeping production in check  particularly in North America and Europe  
During the company s post second quarter earnings call  Magna CFO Vince Galifi warned of further softening in North America and Europe  amid heightened macroeconomic uncertainty 
Magna is expected to report earnings of  1 34 a share on revenue  9 31 billion  Those results would be down from a year ago s earnings of  1 56 a share on revenue of  9 62 billion  
The stock was up 0 23  on Thursday and hit a 52 week high of  57 09 during the session  The shares are up 24 6  in 2019  compared with 23  for the S P 500 index ",2019-11-07,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-2015305,2015305
325146,ABC,PharMerica  AbbVie  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  Habit Restaurants And Shake Shack Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   May 18  2016   highlights PharMerica Corporation    as the Bull of the Day and AbbVie    as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on   Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  Inc      Habit Restaurants  Inc      and Shake Shack  NYSE SHAK   Inc     

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  

  

PharMerica Corporation    is an  800 million pharmacy services provider for institutional customers and patients in long term care settings 

The stock became a Zacks  1 Rank recently after another solid earnings report where they once again beat analyst EPS estimates by 20  for the fourth consecutive quarter 

On May 6 the company reported total revenue of  524 5 million  up 2 5  from last year s first quarter  and beating the analyst consensus by 3   The top line beat was driven by a higher than expected number of prescriptions dispensed  which totaled 8 6 million  Revenue per prescription dispensed in the quarter came in at  60 66 

Analysts Prescribe Better Outlook

In response to the company s outlook and reaffirmed 2016 guidance of revenue in the range of  2 125 billion to  2 150 billion and adjusted EPS in the range of  1 95 to  2 05  analysts scrambled to raise estimates 

In the past 30 days  the 2016 consensus went from  1 74 to  2 02 and full year 2017 projections rose 15  from  1 96 to  2 26 

Analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets described the quarter as offering solid evidence of PharMerica s value proposition  Specifically they noted  The company remains on track toward creating value by expanding its mix of faster growing specialty diversified pharmacy services and using its cash flow to fold in small LTC and home infusion pharmacy acquisitions   The analysts reiterated their Overweight rating and raised their price target from  33 to  34 

Under the Hood of a Key Pharmacy Player

PharMerica offers a broad range of pharmacy services across multiple settings of care ranging from hospitals to nursing facilities and even in home pharmacy services required after a hospital stay  The specialize in senior long term care and specialty oncology services that traditional community pharmacies don t address 

PharMerica was formed as a public company in 2007 through the combination of the institutional pharmacy business of national healthcare services company Kindred Healthcare  Inc  and pharmaceutical services company AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  Corporation 

According to Wikipedia   In August 2011  pharmacy services provider Omnicare made a bid of  457 million for all outstanding shares of PharMerica  The Federal Trade Commission sued Omnicare to block the deal on the basis that the FTC believed the acquisition would lead to higher drug prices  In February 2012  Omnicare allowed its offer to the shareholders of PharMerica to expire  

I m sure that PMC shareholders since 2012 are quite satisfied with this result as the shares have advanced from the low teens  And I think that the recently tested multi year support tested in March at  20 gives a good risk reward reference for the stock 

Bottom Line  PMC Delivers

PharMerica ranks as an industry leading U S  provider of institutional pharmacy services in terms of annual revenues 

And those strong revenues create a compelling value case with a remarkable Price to Sales ratio of 0 40 

This is why PMC has one of the top Zacks composite style scores of  A  for all three metrics of Value  Growth  and Momentum 

And it s why you should consider PMC one of your top plays in the pharmacy industry 

  

AbbVie    was big in the news this week after Federal regulators agreed to review a key patent for the anti inflammatory drug Humira  knocking the stock down 3 5  on over three times the average volume of 9 million shares 

According to a story from Dow Jones on Tuesday by Anne Steele  the US Patent and Trademark Office s Patent Trial and Appeal Board took up a petition by hopeful rival Coherus BioSciences to look at AbbVie s patent on a Humira dosing regimen to treat rheumatoid arthritis 

But ABBV shares were already pushed into the cellar of the Zacks Rank before this news because of a slide in earnings estimates over the past 30 days  Full year 2106 profit projections fell from  5 00 to  4 77 and the 2017 consensus EPS estimate dropped from  5 99 to  5 73 

And that loss of earnings momentum is what makes ABBV today s Bear of the Day by virtue of its Zacks  5 Rank  Strong Sell   This simply means that relative to over 4 000 other stocks across all sectors  ABBV has poor prospects for a price advance because of the magnitude and agreement of negative EPS revisions from analysts 

The Coherus Challenge

Part of this action by analysts in the past month may have been in anticipation of the move by Federal patent authorities  Coherus management revealed at an investor conference in January that the company planned to file an application this year to market a biosimilar  generic  version of Humira 

On Tuesday  Coherus Chief Executive Denny Lanfear said they are  confident that this will lead to a final decision nullifying  the patent 

Shares Coherus shot up nearly 16  to  18 83 on very strong volume of 1 6 million shares  over five times their daily average 

AbbVie responded  we are confident in the validity of our patents and will vigorously defend them  

 Humira is protected by many patents covering all aspects of its manufacture  formulation and indications  and the patents are the result of AbbVie s investment in biologic innovation and the unique attributes of Humira   a spokesperson said 

According to the Dow Jones article by Anne Steele  Humira was the second best selling drug in the U S  in 2015 and is AbbVie s largest source of revenue 

AbbVie has also been preparing for this competitive battle by taking out about 70 patents for Humira  one of the largest patent portfolios ever assembled for a single drug 

Again from Steele   The drug s primary U S  patent is due to expire in December  but AbbVie says the additional patents should keep copycat versions of Humira off the U S  market until at least 2022  and possibly longer  

Bottom Line for ABBV  Watch the Zacks Rank

While this patent battle could actually become a multi year war  after today s big news the analysts may continue to revise ABBV estimates downward  And that could keep it in the basement of the Zacks Rank for a while

And with respect to  business fixed investment and net exports have been soft   industrial production swung from  0 8  expansion in January to  0 5  shrinkage in February  further  export and import prices for February respectively fell  0 4  and  0 1    Soft  or  Thud   As for  strong job gains   would not strong  payroll  gains be more accurate  February s average work week fell from 34 6 to 34 4 hours  which as we pointed out two weeks ago was the largest drop in two years  i e  more folks are doing the same job   How about  Inflation picked up in recent months   The wholesale measure  PPI  went from  0 1  in January to  0 2  in February  whilst the retail measure went from 0 0  as well to  0 2   All that said  here s a unique thought  perhaps the Fed is behind the curve   that or they need a new Policy Statement writer   Either way  as a late great friend of The Gold Update might have put it   They need to get hip to the haps  
 What is hip       Tower of Power   73  is Gold  Recall back on 11 February  having rocketed up through the start of the year  that at 1247 we pointed out price vis   vis our BEGOS valuation was some 167 points  too high   Quel d sastre  Now here s the awesome bit  this form of valuation  the regressing of gold s price movements to those of the BEGOS components    Bond   Euro   Gold   Oil   S P 500  has supportively caught up in full to gold s level as we see in the following year over year chart  the smooth pearly line is that of valuation  the lower panel being the oscillator  of price less valuation  

Next we go from a year s worth of daily prices to the weekly bars from a year ago to date  as gold continues to endure the whirlwinds of the hardened 1240 1280 resistance zone  One may be heard to cry out   Oh  my kingdom for 1290    but lest we forget  those 1290s have been provenly whiny  Gold s key here is to gain grip rather than give it all back  Structurally  that apex at the chart s center  1184  is a very visible level to hold should gold somewhat fold 

 Course  with respect to that 1240 1280 resistance zone  much of our ballyhoo is toward gold getting clear above that area   again only to then have to deal with  The Whiny 1290s    but that d be good enough for us to declare that  the bottom is in   such low being 1045 from last 03 December   Remember  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  sees 1000 in a year s time   albeit we prefer to give their gold shorts short shrift   Either way  here again are our criteria as to when we ll say that  the bottom is in   followed by the chart of Gold s daily settles since the highest ever of 1900 on 22 August 2011 
  The weekly parabolic trend ought be Long   tis    Price ought be above the 300 day moving average   tis    The 300 day moving average itself ought be rising   tis    Price ought trade at least one full week clear above 1280  hasn t 

Next let s move on to our  Baby Blues   those dots that show us the day by day consistency of 21 day linear regression trends  And yes  we must bring Sister Silver into the mix here  for as shown on the right in the following graphic covering three months of daily bars  her blue dots are in robust ascent  whereas on the left  those for gold continue to work lower  which  as noted a week ago  normally is a portent for a price pull back  Nonetheless  as we re sure many of you know  the price ratio of gold silver has all but doubled since the Precious Metals Highs of 2011  the bear may thus say  gold has gone up way too much   but given our current opening Gold Scoreboard value level of 2547  not only does gold have ever so a long way up to go  but moreover  silver is farther behind still  Per their present prices  in round numbers   Gold at 1256 is 35  below its highest trade ever  1923      but Sister Silver at 16 is 68  below her highest trade ever  50   She needs more than just catch up  bring on some mustard  pickles and high protein bacon to further power this sterling baby higher 

As for the input from our  To and Fro Dept    below we ve the 10 day Market Profiles for both gold  left  and silver  right   their respective settles from yesterday  Friday  being the white bar in each panel  and their near term support resistance prices as labeled 

 What about the stock market  mmb  it s lookin  good  
Squire  your misuse of the vernacular puts us in mind of the FOMC Policy Statement which we parsed at the outset  Rather  I would substitute your phrase  it s lookin  good  for   tis quite harrowing   In recent articles  we ve graphically pointed to the stark lack of supportive monetary inflow for the renewed S P rally  which continued during this past week  in the last three trading days  the S P gained 34 points  however the moneyflow was only supportive of  21 points  Underscoring that  the moneyflow itself is  thinning  as we calculate it  one month ago on 19 February  it took  443 888 to move the S P 500 Index one point  in either direction   today that s down to  386 396  put another way  it takes 11  less horsepower to move the S P one point today than it did a month ago   which  if you re part of the stock buy back binge  may make it easier by your being able to bid your own stock lower prior to scooping it back up   Then of course  if you peek again at the Econ Baro near this missive s opening  the rising S P is again ignoring the declining Baro  month to date   Finally  add in our calculation of the S P s price earnings ratio per yesterday s close to be 38 8x  and your money manager s got one harrowing problem of how to explain stuff when it all goes wrong  At least Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   cut  its 12 month target for the S P from 2175 to 2050  Why  that s where  tis now   We re maintaining our S P target for the low 1400s by year s end

High Quality Dividend Stocks   ETFs for Uncertain Markets

Stocks have retreated after three days of gains early last week but major indexes are still near their all time highs  While rising oil prices and dovish comments by the Fed Chair boosted stocks  there is no shortage of worries for investors in this market and it remains to be seen if investors will be able to overcome those worries and take the indexes to new highs 
	In the near term  there is more likelihood of consolation with a downwards bias  Investors  lack of conviction in the rally is evident from the fact that defensive sectors like Utilities and Telecom have remained buoyant  Gold is now near its three week high and bond yields continue to plunge with heavy investor demand  signaling investors do not believe global growth is going to pick up anytime soon

439752,WFC,High nicotine e cigarettes flood market despite FDA rule,news,"By Chris Kirkham  Reuters    The sleek Juul electronic cigarettes have become a phenomenon at U S  high schools  vexing educators and drawing regulatory scrutiny over their sweet flavors and high nicotine content  Now  a new wave of lower priced Juul knock offs is showing up at convenience stores  vape shops and online   despite a U S  Food and Drug Administration rule banning the sale of new e cigarette products after August 2016 without regulatory approval  Start ups and major tobacco firms have launched more than a dozen new high nicotine devices with Juul like designs since the FDA imposed the deadline  according to a Reuters review of the companies  online advertisements  social media posts and public statements  The FDA earlier this month threatened to ban Juul and four other leading vaping products unless their makers take steps to prevent use by minors  But the warning came after companies introduced a slew of new Juul copycats following the August 2016 deadline with no regulatory consequences  In a statement to Reuters  the agency said it was investigating whether certain brands are being improperly sold without FDA approval and that it  plans to take additional action on this front very soon   The agency said it would focus on products with high nicotine concentrations and flavors appearing to target young people  and take  swift action wherever appropriate   The FDA set the August 2016 deadline to rein in the fast growing industry but allowed sales of Juul and other older devices to continue without regulatory approval until 2022  The companies that started marketing new devices after the deadline include startup firms such as Kandypens  Myle Vapor and VGOD  as well as large multinational tobacco companies including  British American Tobacco   LON BATS  Plc and Imperial Brands  LON IMB  Plc  Kandypens touted its new Rubi vaping device last October   more than 14 months after the August 2016 cutoff   with an Instagram post saying it had been  working hard over here for the last 12 months  on the product  Vaping distributor VGOD posted on its website in May that it was  an honor to finally introduce the STIG   referencing its Stig Pods  a disposable three pack of high nicotine devices  British American Tobacco chief executive Nicandro Durante said on a July 2018 earnings call that the company would be launching its higher nicotine Vuse Alto product in the United States the following month  Imperial Brands announced its myblu brand of e cigarettes in a February 2018 press release  Kandypens  Myle and VGOD did not respond to requests for comment  Spokespeople for Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco said their products were compliant and on the market before August 2016  Imperial Brands said it had purchased an existing e cigarette brand and renamed it  British American Tobacco did not respond to questions about its marketing or sales  A spokeswoman for Juul Labs Inc  Victoria Davis  said the company is cooperating with regulators and working to prevent underage use of a product designed to help adult smokers quit tobacco cigarettes    No minor or non nicotine user should ever try Juul   Davis said  E cigarettes vaporize a liquid that contains nicotine  the addictive stimulant that gives smokers a rush  The Juul design mimics a flash drive   with plug in cartridges of concentrated nicotine juice  It is far more compact than earlier vaping devices and produces less vapor  making it easy to use without being detected   an attribute some health advocates say attracts teenagers  Juul s imitators are also small and compatible with higher nicotine blends  though some can also be filled with lower strength juice  The Chinese company Suorin introduced several such devices to the United States over the past year  Many high schoolers and college students said they have switched to these products because buying widely available nicotine liquids is less expensive than Juul pods   In a statement  Suorin said it didn t have  clear guidance  from the FDA on regulations governing its newer products but hopes to better understand how to fully comply  The company said its products are only intended for adult smokers  One Juul pod has the nicotine content of about 20 cigarettes   the number in a traditional pack   according to Juul s marketing  A pod can be consumed in a day by a heavy user  according to interviews with Juul customers  Many of the newest blends from Juul and its imitators   called  nicotine salts  in the industry   contain a compound called benzoic acid  which lowers the pH level of the liquid  That reduction allows users to take in more nicotine without a bitter taste  according to the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   In addition to the devices  dozens of high nicotine e liquids have arrived on the market with names such as  frozen mystery pop    rainbow drops  and  Tokyo chocolate banana   which critics say are designed to attract young customers  Vaping proponents argue the Juul and similar new products give cigarette smokers looking to quit a much better option than lower nicotine e cigarettes   It gives the same exact sensation as a cigarette  except you don t wake up coughing at 2 a m    said Charles Trejo  a manager at V for Vape  a Los Angeles retailer  Public health researchers say high nicotine vaping devices like the Juul have proven adept at drawing in new customers  including teenagers  who never used tobacco   What they re doing is creating addicts in large numbers   said Dr  Robert Jackler  a professor who heads a group studying the impact of tobacco advertising at Stanford University  High nicotine vaping devices amount to a  weaponisation  of the drug  he said  citing research showing young people are particularly susceptible to nicotine addiction  which could lead them to other addictions including cigarettes  HIGH SCHOOL  JUUL ROOMS  The companies launched the copycat devices as Juul s market share surged from 13 6 percent of the e cigarette market in early 2017 to more than 70 percent now  according to a  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analysis of Nielsen retail data  which does not include online sales  The FDA s regulation of e cigarettes has come under scrutiny in recent months as Juul s popularity has taken off  Anti smoking advocates complained about the Juul lookalikes in an August letter to the FDA  saying the agency had failed to assert its authority over companies that had  evaded the review process   The FDA said it planned to respond to the letter but declined further comment  Vaping increased by nearly eightfold between 2011 and 2017 among U S  high school students  according to the most recent CDC data  Experts say last year s survey likely underestimates the increase because it was conducted before a surge in Juul sales  Many high schools have resorted to locking bathrooms   jokingly called  Juul rooms  by students  Marcella Bianco  who helps develop school anti vaping curriculum for the non profit organization Catch My Breath  said elementary schools have recently started requesting materials  Educators fear the high nicotine devices could erode decades of progress in reducing youth tobacco use  Smoking among high school students declined from 15 8 percent to 7 6 percent between 2011 and 2017  according to the CDC  but e cigarette use grew from 1 5 percent to 11 7 percent over the same period   It s like a flashback to 20 years ago   said Kathryn Hensley  a school board member in St  Lucie County  Fla   Are we starting all over again   E cigarettes have occupied a regulatory gray area in the United States since they emerged a decade ago  Only in 2016 did the FDA finalize rules to regulate e cigarettes  including the requirement that companies get approval for new products  Research on the long term health effects of e cigarettes is limited  They are widely viewed as safer than tobacco cigarettes because they don t contain the same cocktail of toxic and cancer causing chemicals  The U K  Royal College of Physicians said in a 2016 report that e cigarettes were 95 percent less harmful than smoking tobacco  citing a reduction in the risk of serious disease and death  The CDC has said e cigarettes are safer than conventional cigarettes but has not assigned a specific risk reduction because the products can vary widely  Some health experts are particularly worried about the impact of nicotine from e cigarettes on adolescents  Research from a 2016 U S  Surgeon General s report found that such exposure could have  lasting adverse consequences for brain development and cognition  on teenagers  A study released by the National Academy of Sciences this year cited evidence that vaping among young people increases the risk of eventually smoking tobacco  BANNED IN OTHER COUNTRIES High nicotine vaping devices and liquids are not allowed in many other parts of the world  including in the European Union and the United Kingdom  which have both set nicotine limits at 20 mg mL in e cigarette liquids  Regulators said that level was effective for most smokers trying to quit  Juul pods are rated at 59 mg mL  according to the company s marketing  Israeli regulators last month banned Juul out of concern over its high nicotine content  saying the device  posed serious danger to public health    Davis  the Juul Labs spokeswoman  said in August the company was  incredibly disappointed  with what it called the Israeli government s  misguided decision  to crack down on healthier alternatives to tobacco cigarettes  The company has since introduced a lower nicotine version of the product in Israel that it says complies with regulations there  Davis said Juul believes the higher nicotine version of the product still provides the best option for smokers trying to quit  Imperial Brands  new myblu product arrived in the United States earlier this year  Matt Kessler  a spokesman for Fontem Ventures  the Imperial Brands unit that owns myblu  said the brand complies with the FDA rules because it is a re imagination of a similar e cigarette that was marketed by a company that Imperial brands acquired a year earlier  The new myblu brand  however  offers 4 percent nicotine strength  meaning at least 40 mg mL  according to company advertising  higher than any previously offered by the earlier e cigarette model  called My Von Erl  Devices that vaporize higher nicotine liquids fall under the definition of new products subject to FDA review  according to the 2016 regulation  Kessler declined to comment further on nicotine levels in myblu  saying only that the product  is compliant with FDA regulations   Durante  the CEO of British American Tobacco  acknowledged on the July earnings call that its Vuse Alto device had not been widely available before the August 2016 deadline  He said that s not required under FDA rules   To be grandfathered  by the FDA  he said   you could be in market  in one store  two stores only in the whole country    The FDA declined to comment on whether myblu and Vuse Alto are compliant or if availability in one or two stores would be considered  on the market   The agency said it would consider  the totality of the evidence  to decide a whether a vaping product had been commercially available before the regulatory deadline  STRUGGLE TO QUIT As new high nicotine Juul competitors arrive  vaping enthusiasts on YouTube are posting reviews of the next  Juul killer  aiming to take a piece of the red hot market  Milo Gringlas  a freshman at Cornell University  said Juul has become so ubiquitous on campus that a popular late night food truck now sells vaping devices and nicotine liquids    Everybody either has one or is looking for one   he said  Austin Tompkins  who lives in Los Angeles  has struggled for the last six months to kick his addiction to Juul  which he started using about three years ago  when he was 19  He realized he needed to stop when he would wake up in the middle of the night needing another hit  In his latest attempt  he s made it two months without vaping  The urge hasn t gone away  
 I m telling you  right now  I would love a hit of a Juul   he said ",2018-09-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/special-report-highnicotine-ecigarettes-flood-market-despite-fda-rule-1620974,1620974

395613,IBM,Earnings Preview  IBM  IBM  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when IBM  IBM  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 16  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This technology and consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 22 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 4  
Revenues are expected to be  18 65 billion  down 2 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for IBM 
For IBM  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that IBM will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that IBM would post earnings of  4 81 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 87  delivering a surprise of  1 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
IBM doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-ibm-ibm-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200405143,200405143
367061,STT,ANALYSIS Flickers of optimism as stocks climb despite gloom,news,"By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  Feb 6  Reuters    German industrial output slumps to
its worst level since unification  U S  monthly job losses are
the biggest for 34 years  Equity markets rally 
 Something is going on in financial markets that suggests
investors may believe that a bottom is here or near for the
global economic downturn and the stock market collapse 
 Reaction to the two bits of gloomy data on Friday was nearly
nonchalant  MSCI s all country world stock index  boosted by
gains across Wall Street  Europe and Asia  headed for its
seventh positive session in the past 10 
 What appears to be happening is that a scattered series of
improvements in macroeconomic data  some of which is just not as
bad as expected  is outweighing more dire reports 
 It has combined with a growing faith that government bailout
and stimulus plans will work  On Friday  markets were driven
forward by growing hopes that a  900 billion plus U S  economic
package would be passed by Congress soon 
 The gist of the flickering optimism is that the much touted
green shoots of economic recovery may be about to pop up out of
the recessionary mire 
  For those of an optimistic bent  credit markets have    
begun to function  money supply is up and investment flows into
emerging markets remain positive   State Street said in a note
that otherwise showed highly cautious investment flows 
  This might yet prove to be the last hurrah of extreme risk
aversion   it said 
 The evidence for optimism comes from two places  First 
there have been better than expected economic reports 
 Arguably the chief among these was a rise in China s
official manufacturing index  which was coupled with a surge in
bank lending and a comment from the central bank that government
stimulus shows some signs of early success 
 China s economic recovery is widely seen as a crucial
element in any global upswing 
 Other relatively upbeat reports have included an unexpected
improvement in Germany s business confidence and Belgium s
bellwether equivalent  and a surprise surge in U S 
existing home sales 
 The Baltic Exchange Dry Index  a proxy for world trade  is
up more than 100 percent for the year so far 
 
 RELATIVITY THEORY
 Jean Claude Trichet  the European Central Bank president 
has noticed 
  There have been tentative signs of stabilisation in some
survey data  albeit at historically low levels   he said while
holding rates steady on Thursday 
 Improvements have also been noted within the battered
financial sector  Citi Private Bank told its clients this week
that seven out of nine indicators it has designated as
 signposts  to recovery improved in January 
 Among them were a narrowing LIBOR OIS spread  suggesting an
easing of money market tension  and an overall better reading
from Citi s proprietary financial conditions index based on
lower energy costs and growing money supply 
 The second optimism boost has essentially been the fact that
equity markets also appear to have bottomed or be bottoming
after last year s massive falls 
 The MSCI world index is trading in a range above the trough
it hit last November  a low it has not really threatened to sink
to again despite a bearish January 
 This has firms such as the giant investor BlackRock saying
that equities are in a zone that offer reasonable prices 
 Wealth managers at Credit Suisse  meanwhile  are urging
clients to be a bit less cautious  They have cut back on
defensive stocks  for example  and become a bit more positive
about cyclicals that do better when economies improve 
  There are signs of the beginning of an  economic  bottoming
out process   Giles Keating  head of global research at Credit
Suisse Private Bank  told Reuters Global Investing blog
   
  There is deep value out there in some equities   he said 
 
 CAUTIONARY TALE
 Not all the news  or course  has been conducive to this
tentative optimism  as the U S  and German data showed on
Friday 
 Many investors are also quick not to rule out deeper losses
on world equity markets 
 Even as Keating was painting a picture of improving markets 
for example  he said it was  unlikely to be realised in a smooth
process  
 Investment surveys also show little in the way of risk
appetite 
 State Street said its institutional investor clients

372062,ETN,Next wave of U S  LNG export projects to be  tougher   Blackstone Energy CEO,news,"By Collin  Eaton   NYSE ETN 
HOUSTON  Reuters    The next wave of U S  liquefied natural gas  LNG  export projects will be  tougher  to bring online  as companies with existing facilities take advantage of lower costs to expand capacity in coming years  the chief executive of Blackstone  NYSE BX  Energy Partners said on Wednesday 
Blackstone CEO David Foley said at the Gastech Energy Conference in Houston that only one or two new startup projects may reach a final investment decision  FID  in the next wave of U S  LNG export projects 
 In terms of liquefaction capacity that gets FID from the U S   the hit rate will be a lot higher on projects either sponsored by major oil companies or expansions of existing facilities   Foley said 
The energy focused private equity group  a unit of Blackstone Group  has owned a stake in Cheniere Energy  A LNG   the nation s biggest LNG exporter  since 2012  Cheniere was the first company to build a large LNG export terminal in the lower 48 states  which started shipping to other markets in February 2016 
The United States began shipping LNG to foreign customers from the lower 48 states in 2016  with exports reaching a record 5 2 billion cubic feet per day in July  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration 
Demand for the gas that is super cooled so that it can be transported on ships has increased from numerous markets  particularly from China and India  to meet growing energy demand while moving away from dirtier coal plants 
Operators are racing to reach FID new U S  export projects that would sell cargoes into a global market where excess supply  which is currently abundant  is expected to shrink within five years 
Five LNG projects reached FID this year  more than any other year  with three in the United States  and the others in Mozambique and Russia  Combined  the projects would have capacity of 9 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day  according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie 
 Things have already surprised us to the upside   said Alex Munton  principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie   Before 2018 there was a feeling U S  LNG had pretty much happened  that all you could hope to see were incremental expansions  
Several U S  projects have said they expect to make decisions on going ahead with construction in coming months 
Venture Global LNG announced FID for its Calcasieu Pass LNG facility and a related pipeline in Louisiana last month ",2019-09-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/next-wave-of-us-lng-export-projects-to-be-tougher-blackstone-energy-ceo-1981093,1981093
343362,NYT,Politicized Market Is Last Bastion Of  Economic Strength ,opinion,The VIX is in a second stage pullback from Mid Cycle resistance at 24 35 back to its Head   Shoulders neckline today  It overshot the neckline on the first pullback and the second one is not as deep  but we would not like to see it go beneath short term support at 20 85  which is just above the neckline  There is a minor pivot this weekend  so it is possible that TPTB will not like to see the VIX make a new high before the weekend  This market is extremely politicized and appears to be the last bastion of perceived strength for  the economy    However  here is what the  is saying   If we keep following the pattern of the triple Orthodox Broadening Top  SPY may linger near the overhead resistance of the trendline for yet another day  but be assured that the trend is still down  Short term resistance is almost precisely at the neckline at 133 39  so we may use that as a partial stop loss for our short positions  if needed  I say only partial  since the Cyclical measure of the downtrend is Mid Cycle resistance at 134 75  There is a new Head   Shoulders neckline at 129 55 that  if broken  assure that the downtrend will continue  Wall Street and its minions will make every attempt not to cross the neckline before the weekend  IMO  Meanwhile   are fleeing the market  UUP appears to have made a Primary Cycle double pivot with a high on May 16 and a low on May 21  exactly 4 3 days apart  It appears to have started a minor wave iii  which suggests that it may break above its neckline at 22 95  Fibonacci targeting agrees with the Head   Shoulders target  It has also launched above Cycle Top resistance at 22 70  which may now be support for the duration of this rally  There may be a retest of support before UUP moves higher  I have inserted a weekly chart of FXE to show that it has indeed closed beneath its new Head   Shoulders neckline at 125 75  The probability of a waterfall decline is extraordinarily high  The bounce that started last Thursday was a complete failure  ending in a  double pivot  Trading Cycle within a span of 4 3 days  The next major pivot low may arrive by June 15  The Orthodox Broadening Top agrees with the target for the massive Head   Shoulders at 125 75  which portends a decline to parity        In understanding just how bad things are for European banks  it is important to focus on  how much loss absorbing capital there is beneath you in the bank s liability stack  as this is the capital that will take losses before senior creditors in the event of a bail in  which means looking at deposits as well as secured encumbrance  What is very apparent from the pictorial representations of banks  liability structures is that rather than encumbrance from covered bonds LTRO etc  the bigger issue for encumbrance of senior unsecured investors is the potential threat from depositor  runs    TLT made yet another breakout  then retested its Cycle Top support at 122 47  It appears that this powerful thrust is taking no prisoners as it marches parabolically higher  We may have seen the top of wave iii  which exceeded the target for the Head   Shoulders pattern  If this is correct  we may see TLT drop to its trendline and short term support at 120 74 before moving higher  If the pattern is correct  I expect the wave v thrust of this pattern may terminate on or near June 12 with a probable target of 130 24  Keep in mind that this may be the final high  and it may be all downhill from there  GLD bounced again from a major Head   Shoulders neckline yesterday and made a partial retracement that appears to be a truncated wave c  It is difficult to judge just yet  but the correction may be over  What seems to be happening now is that GLD may be setting up for a massive wave iii of  iii  once it falls through the neckline  This gives GLD about three weeks to decline into a Primary Cycle low expecting a bottom in mid June   writes    as of minutes ago  the CME for Crude  CL  and Gold  GC  by 13  and 10  respectively  At this point we doubt it will do much if anything    On the contrary  it may stop the rally in its tracks  USO crossed beneath the neckline of the larger Head   Shoulders pattern with a new target at 26 50 and appears to have tested it already  This suggests a swift drop to its target in the next three weeks  What appears to be taking place  is that USO is about to enter wave  iii  of 3  which may be stronger than the Head   Shoulders pattern indicates  Fibonacci relationships suggest a decline to 22 00 in wave  iii        Over the past 2 months two things have happened  chatter of  imminent  war with Iran has died down to barely a whisper  and WTI is now trading 20  lower than 2012 highs  Which means there is far more capacity for a run higher  So putting all that together  does it mean that the prospect of war with Iran is now gone  FXI has broken the lower Head   Shoulders neckline with a new  lower target  The initial Head   Shoulders pattern fell short of its target as roughly 33  of these patterns do  However  that statistic may not be a detriment in using the pattern  especially with other models  The Cycles Model suggests that we may see the decline continue through the second week of June  when a Master Cycle low is due  It has some subdividing yet to do between now and its target low date  but the consolidations will likely be compressed into shorter periods INDY met the minimum target of its minor Head   Shoulders pattern yesterday  It is now in a wave ii bounce  preparing to break the massive Head   Shoulders neckline below 19 31  It is due for a Master Cycle low in mid June  This pattern has become complex  but Head   Shoulders patterns launch wave threes  This pattern may be an interesting one to watch unfold XLF may add a little more to its bounce before piercing its Head   Shoulders neckline at 130 70  The Broadening Wedge no longer has the deeper target  but it is good to have a  second opinion  on the extent of the decline  The current decline should take XLF to its November low or possibly to the massive  probable  neckline at the bottom of the chart  It appears now that XLF shares a virtually identical cycle with FXE  Both are expected to reach their respective Master Cycle lows in mid June       A good read JPMorgan s flacks and apologists have  unintentionally  exposed the fact that their cover story   hedging gone bad   is false  JPMorgan runs the world s largest gambling operation in financial derivatives  The New York Times reported the key facts  but not the analytics  in an article entitled  The analytics suggest that the latest JPMorgan cover story   it was JPMorgan s  Achilles the heel   based in the UK  who caused the loss   is misleading    The volume of searches for the phrase  has just hit an all time high   higher now than even during the peak of the Lehman Brothers  moment  ,2012-05-28,Anthony M.

262680,BAC,On the QT  Markets are Being Roiled by Quantitative Tightening,news," Bloomberg     That whooshing sound you hear is the draining of  1 4 trillion worth of global liquidity 
Quantitative tightening  or the unwinding of central banks  extraordinary stimulus  has been the primary driver of asset class performance this year  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  analysts say  The march higher in U S  interest rates and tighter financial conditions mean securities that did well during quantitative easing  such as corporate bonds and emerging market debt  are now underperforming  while  QE losers  have become stars 
The year marks a shift in a tide of global liquidity that helped push up asset prices  according to Merrill Lynch s analysis  Securities purchases from the Fed  European Central Bank and Bank of Japan are just  125 billion year to date  well below the  1 5 trillion run rate of 2017  they estimate  That suggests markets are missing an injection of some  1 38 trillion thanks to policy makers changing tack 
Liquidity will see an outright contraction in six to eight months  the strategists estimated    one reason they re bearish on global markets even after recent declines  The following is a look at what s changing in global markets 
Short Term Rates
Treasury bills have been among the securities that reacted fastest to monetary stimulus withdrawal  Yields steadily rose as traders responded to the potential for more aggressive tightening from the Fed  as well as increased bill supply to fund fiscal deficits 
Investors are taking advantage  ETFs that invest in ultra short term debt have attracted almost  18 billion so far this year  accounting for about 35 percent of their assets under management  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
King Dollar
The dollar has renewed its relationship with the rates market  moving higher in sync with benchmark rates  The increasing yield premium over peers finally brought an end to a five quarter slump in the Bloomberg Dollar Index  It reached a one year high last week 
 The dollar s doing a stalwart job of re coupling with yields  and in real effective terms it s not a million miles from getting back to its January 2017 peak    Societe Generale   PA SOGN  SA strategist Kit Juckes said in a note last week  Since both real and nominal yields are higher than January 2017 and the  global economy overall is facing political dangers   the dollar could return to its cycle peak soon enough  he said 
Emerging Markets
The combination of higher U S  yields and a stronger greenback has rippled through developing markets  as investors fret over the ability of developing nations to pay off dollar denominated debt  A fifth of emerging markets and middle income countries have debt levels above 70 percent of GDP  according to the IMF  and developing economies  dollar borrowings grew 10 percent in 2017 
 This rolling EM meltdown is another expression of the  QE to QT  reality  as the easy carry environment of the post global financial crisis period is now coming home to roost   said Charlie McElligott  a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc  Investors sold a record  6 billion from dedicated global EM funds last week  according to Sanford C  Bernstein   Co 
Credit Divergence
Longer duration investment grade bonds    or those most exposed to moves in rates    have underperformed their shorter duration high yield counterparts  The Bloomberg  Barclays   LON BARC  U S  Corporate Investment Grade Index is down over 3 percent this year  while the high yield equivalent is up about 0 5 percent 
The moves have also triggered an unusual divergence between equity and credit markets  While stock investors have been avoiding leverage  preferring the shares of companies with stronger balance sheets  credit traders have gone the other way  seeking out those with the riskiest debt 
The equity credit gap  confirms investors remain in a barbell of  uber growth  in equities and  uber yield  in credit  which has been the dominant themes during the QE era   said Tommy Ricketts  investment strategist at Bank of America   That trade is getting narrower and narrower now though  
Volatility
Volatility has also sprung to life in 2018  with the Cboe s Volatility Index averaging 16 31 this year  compared with 11 09 in 2017  Even so  for Unicredit  MI CRDI  SpA strategist Elia Lattuga  volatility had appeared  a tad too detached  from recent developments across the globe 
 As unprecedented measures are reined in  financial conditions will tighten and global asset prices will have to adjust to the new regime   Lattuga wrote in a recent note to clients   We think that credit spreads and equity valuations are set to become increasingly sensitive to changes in market sentiment and macro developments  ",2018-06-27,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/on-the-qt-markets-are-being-roiled-by-quantitative-tightening-1510318,1510318

434698,WMB,UK Queen Elizabeth s grandson splits from wife  Sun,news,"LONDON  Reuters    Peter Phillips  the grandson of Britain s Queen Elizabeth  has separated from his Canadian wife after 12 years of marriage  the Sun newspaper reported on Tuesday 
The tabloid said Phillips  the eldest of the British monarch s eight grandchildren  was devastated that his wife Autumn wanted to split up 
The couple  who married in 2008  have two children  Savannah  9  and Isla  7  Buckingham Palace said it had no comment as it was a private matter 
Phillips  42  son of Elizabeth s daughter Princess Anne and 15th in line to the throne  and Autumn  41  met in 2003 at the Montreal Grand Prix  when he worked for the Formula 1 racing team BMW Williams  NYSE WMB  and she worked at the BMW hospitality suite 
They married at the queen s Windsor Castle residence near London  the scene for a number of recent royal weddings including that of another of Elizabeth s grandsons  Prince Harry to his American wife Meghan 
Phillips has no royal title and has tended to stay out of the limelight  He did  however  organize a giant street party in front of Buckingham Palace to celebrate the queen s 90th birthday in 2016 
The Sun said the monarch  93  would be very upset by the news which comes on the back on a series of major setbacks for the royal family 
Harry and Meghan plunged the Windsors into crisis last month when they announced they wanted to cut back on official duties  That led to a deal which means they will retire as working royals to spend more time in Canada and the United States 
Meanwhile  the queen s second son Prince Andrew also stepped down from public duties in November over his connections to sex scandals involving late U S  financier Jeffrey Epstein 
 The queen must wonder what she has done to deserve this   the Sun quoted an unnamed senior royal source as saying 
 Peter Phillips has always been a favorite of hers and Prince Philip and she will be crestfallen by this  especially on top of all the other bad news  It makes you wonder what s going to happen next  ",2020-02-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/uk-queen-elizabeths-grandson-splits-from-wife-sun-2081335,2081335

329961,BLK,Bond Bulls Near First Half Record With  72 Billion ETF Inflows,news," Bloomberg     As the risk of an economic slowdown lingers  exchange traded fund investors are seeking shelter in bond funds 
They ve poured about  72 billion into fixed income ETFs this year through June 24  with the funds on track for their biggest first half inflows ever  according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence  Those bets have also fueled assets in the debt strategies to hit an all time high of nearly  741 billion 
Markets have been whipsawed by mounting concern over softer economic data and President Donald Trump s trade wars with major partners  For a month now  a key part of the Treasury yield curve has been inverted    a phenomenon that s reliably predicted a recession  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the downside risks to the U S  economy have increased recently  reinforcing the case among policy makers for somewhat lower interest rates 
 Bond ETFs are punching way above their weight  They re having a huge year   said Eric Balchunas  an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence   Fixed income is the benefactor of an overall hangover from last year and nervousness about money going forward  
For the Long Term
That s encouraged investors toward long duration debt funds  which saw inflows of more than  8 6 billion this year through June 24  according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence 
The largest in the category  the  14 4 billion iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  ETF  or TLT  has seen assets surge 65  after taking in  4 5 billion during that period  Meanwhile  the iShares 7 10 Year Treasury Bond  NYSE IEF  ETF  or IEF  has posted inflows of about  5 5 billion  already surpassing its previous record high in 2014 
That s an indication that investors are betting interest rates will stay lower for longer  according to Chris Gaffney  president of world markets at TIAA Bank 
 They re willing to accept the current interest rates over the long period   Gaffney said in an interview at Bloomberg s New York headquarters   When you lengthen duration like that  when you re looking at the long end of the curve  obviously you re thinking that you re willing to lock in those lower rates for a longer period because you don t think interest rates are going anywhere  
Ultra Short
While the longer end of the yield curve has been a favorite pocket for bond buyers  debt investors also upped their exposures at the other extreme  In June  funds tracking securities with less than a year to maturity took in  4 8 billion  on track for the biggest month of inflows since November  according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence 
BlackRock Inc  NYSE BLK   s iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF  ticker SHV  is on pace for a record monthly inflow of more than  4 billion  while  State Street  Corp  NYSE STT   s SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays   LON BARC  1 3 Month T Bill ETF  or BIL  is on track to take about  850 million 
Investors are  searching for yield    it s simply a yield play   said TIAA s Gaffney   The U S  bond market is still the place to park funds  
In Good Company
Another beneficiary of a Fed willing to cut rates to boost growth are funds tracking corporate debt  The  37 billion iShares iBoxx   Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF  ticker LQD  has taken in more than  4 billion through June 24  nearly double its previous monthly record  Meanwhile  the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF  or HYG  has taken in over  3 billion in the same period 
 Investors are saying really low interest rates are fantastic for corporations because they can borrow at low rates   said Priscilla Hancock  managing director of global fixed income  currency and commodities at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  Asset Management 
But Hancock has some concerns that flows could turn negative    especially in riskier assets such as high yield debt    as investors seek safety and exit funds to access liquidity 
 If we re in late cycle  you want to be careful about reaching for too much yield and taking on too much risk  because when you want to get out  everyone else may also want to get out at the same time   she said   I m concerned about where pricing will go when everyone is trying to get out of the eye of the needle  ",2019-06-25,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bond-bulls-near-firsthalf-record-with-72-billion-etf-inflows-1907287,1907287
432493,C,NYMEX  Brent gain as API draws aid sentiment,news,"Investing com   Crude rose in Asia on Wednesday as U S  industry estimates of stockpiles showed drops that signaled solid demand prospects and investors awaited word from the Federal Reserve on intersst rates 
The American Petroleum Institute weekly crude stockpile report showed a larger than expected drop of 1 070 million barrels  while gasoline stock fell by 400 000 barrels  less than expected ahead of the summer driving season  and distillates stocks eased by 1 0 million barrels 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange  WTI crude for June delivery gained 1 00  to  44 48 a barrel  Brent oil gained 0 97  to  46 02 a barrel 
Separately  Wednesday s government report could show that crude inventories nationwide rose by 2 3 million barrels last week  Earlier this week  global energy information provider Genscape  Inc  reported that stockpiles at the Cushing Oil Hub in Oklahoma rose by 1 5 million barrels for the week ending on April 22  Cushing  the nation s largest storage facility  is the main delivery point of NYMEX oil 
Overnight  crude futures surged 2  on Tuesday  amid indications of stronger demand growth in upcoming weeks  ahead of the release of the American Petroleum Institute s weekly inventory report after the close of trading 
On the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE   Brent crude for June delivery wavered between  44 16 and  45 82 a barrel  before closing at  45 51  up 1 19 or 2 69  on the session  Following the solid gains  oil prices worldwide are up by approximately 40  since falling to 12 year lows in mid February  Crude futures are also up nearly 10  since talks at a closely watched meeting in Doha ended prematurely after Saudi Arabia refused to freeze production at January levels  unless Iran also agreed to cap its output 
In June  Saudi state owned oil company Aramco will ship 730 000 barrels in storage in the Japanese prefecture of Okinawa to China s eastern province of Shandong  Reuters reported  At the same time   Citigroup  Inc  NYSE NYSE C  said in a note to investors that the Saudi kingdom could ramp up production by 500 000 bpd to accommodate the new sales  The added output would boost Saudi production to near all time record highs  above 11 million barrels per day 
Any surges in global demand are viewed as bullish for oil  as supply continues to outstrip demand by more than 1 million bpd  It came one day after the Saudi cabinet approved a plan to offer a 5  stake in Aramco in an initial public offering valued as much as  2 trillion 
The Aramco sale is an integral part of the kingdom s comprehensive plan to lessen its reliance on oil by 2030  In an interview with the Saudi state owned al Arabiya network  Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman indicated that national production can remain steady  even as the price of oil hovers around  30 a barrel 
Oil prices have remained persistently low since OPEC roiled global markets in November  2014  with a coordinated effort to maintain its production ceiling above 30 million bpd  Months earlier  crude future prices peaked at  115 a barrel ",2016-04-27,Investing.com,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/nymex,-brent-gain-as-api-draws-aid-sentiment-398141",398141
349077,GOOGL,Facebook warns of costly privacy changes  discloses another U S  probe,news,"By Paresh Dave and Akanksha Rana
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters     Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB  said on Wednesday that new rules and product changes aimed at protecting users  privacy would slow its revenue growth into next year and significantly raise expenses  taking the shine off quarterly revenue results that beat expectations 
The outlook was the latest twist in a day of contrasting news for the world s largest social media company  Facebook earlier agreed to pay  5 billion to settle a U S  Federal Trade Commission data privacy probe but then disclosed that the regulator was now investigating it for anti competitive behavior 
The settlement  which lawmakers and privacy experts criticized as a  slap on the wrist  for a company whose revenues last year topped  55 billion  suggested that Facebook had moved past a major regulatory challenge that has dogged it over the last year 
But Facebook s chief financial officer  Dave Wehner  warned that operational changes required by the settlement would be costly  In addition  he said  revenue will be hurt by new limits on usage of consumer data being set by governments around the world and by tech companies on whose systems Facebook relies  He did not elaborate 
The guidance demonstrates the lasting effects of Facebook s failure over the last decade to adequately secure some users  personal information and inform users how its business partners were accessing the data 
Still  Facebook said the second straight quarter of above expectations revenue showed that its namesake app is producing growth even as users gravitate toward newer  more private features whose popularity has outstripped their usage among advertisers 
Second quarter revenue rose to  16 9 billion from  13 2 billion a year ago  beating analysts  average estimate of  16 5 billion  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
Shares of Facebook  which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram  rose 0 87  after hours to  206 44 after whipsawing amid the results and guidance  The shares have recouped most of the losses sparked a year ago on concerns of slowing usage and the costs of improving privacy 
For the quarter  Facebook reported 2 7 billion monthly users and 2 1 billion daily users across Facebook  Messenger  Instagram and WhatsApp  both figures about the same as last quarter 
 News regarding FTC and data privacy  along with antitrust investigations and additional headline risks  are  likely to continue to hang over the stock  but it looks like the platform still remains a very popular destination for the users   Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said in an email to Reuters 
U S  PROBES
Facebook has faced questions for the past three years from regulators and users worldwide over how services designed to share news and events with friends and family have become platforms for spreading misinformation about politics and health  It also suffered data breaches  prompting investigations in several countries 
The FTC inquiry settled on Wednesday stemmed from allegations that Facebook allowed information belonging to 87 million users to be inappropriately shared with the now defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica 
Facebook  which had set aside  3 billion in the first quarter for the settlement  said it took a  2 billion charge in the second quarter to account for the remainder 
The deal  which is subject to court approval  also requires Facebook to document for the FTC any privacy related decisions about new products  It must establish a privacy committee on its board  and executives must regularly attest to the company s proper handling of user content 
Wehner said the settlement would require  significant investment  in hiring and technology 
The newly disclosed antitrust probe  which Facebook said it learned of from the FTC last month  shows that other regulatory hurdles remain 
Reuters and other news agencies reported in June that the FTC was gearing up to investigate complaints about the massive market power of Facebook and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc s Google 
But Facebook on Wednesday suggested it may also be in the crosshairs of the Justice Department  acknowledging in a statement the agency s announcement a day earlier of an antitrust review of large internet companies  The Justice Department did not specify targets  and Facebook declined to elaborate 
Facebook has expanded programs and promises in response to political pressure on several issues  including policing objectionable content 
Costs jumped 66  compared to a year ago  to nearly  12 3 billion  as Facebook continues to ramp up such initiatives 
The FTC payment in part cut second quarter profit to  2 6 billion  compared with  5 1 billion a year earlier  Excluding the settlement and a  1 1 billion one time tax expense  earnings would have been  1 99 per share  Facebook said 




The expectations for its ad business and cost forecasts could hurt profit margins  particularly in the fourth quarter  Facebook said ",2019-07-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/facebook-discloses-antitrust-probe-revenue-beats-estimates-1933454,1933454

264512,NLOK,Broadcom Earnings Preview  Guidance On 2020 Chip Demand Will Be Crucial,opinion,"  Reports Q4 2019 results on Thursday  Dec  12  after the close
  Revenue expectation   5 74 billion
  EPS expectation   5 36
When Broadcom Inc  NASDAQ AVGO  reports its fourth quarter earnings tomorrow  investors can t afford to ignore it  The San Jose  California based chipmaker is considered a key barometer for the semiconductor industry due to its vast customer base and a diversified product line 
Broadcom s earnings report will also be closely scrutinized to see whether the recent rally in chip stocks has any legs  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which includes some of the world s largest chipmakers  such as Intel Corporation  NASDAQ INTC   NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  and Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD  has surged about 48  in 2019  far exceeding the S P 500 s 24  rise this year 
The rebound came amid optimism that the slowdown which hit the sector last year was short term in nature despite the mixed signals from some of the largest producers 
Nvidia  the industry s biggest maker of chips for computer graphics cards  last month reported quarterly sales that topped analysts  estimates  but the company offered a weak forecast  suggesting demand for gaming graphics chips is recovering slower than predicted 
Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  in October said  most markets weakened further   in the third quarter and gave a fourth quarter revenue forecast that trailed the lowest estimate on Wall Street 
Investors  Bullish Mood
These warnings have so far failed to temper investors  bullish mood about semis  According to analysts  consensus forecasts  the third quarter likely marked a bottom of the industry s down cycle  Growth will then continue to accelerate  By the third quarter of 2020  semi earnings are expected to expand faster than software companies 
For the same reasons  Broadcom s Q4 earnings report and conference call will come under intense scrutiny by investors  who are keen to know if the broad based weakness that chipmakers were facing is over 
Another reason Broadcom s earnings are closely watched  the company derives almost half of its revenue from China  so its sales growth will provide some clues as to how the trade war between the U S  and China is affecting its business  Huawei Technologies Co   which the U S  government has blacklisted  purchases Broadcom switch chips that are a key component in the Chinese company s networking gear 
Broadcom is also a major supplier of chips to Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   making its commentary on the wireless market s demand outlook too important to ignore 
Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan has built a  100 billion company through a spate of acquisitions  including his purchase of part of  Symantec Corp   NASDAQ NLOK  for  10 7 billion in August 
 We believe demand has bottomed out but will continue to remain at these levels due to the current uncertain environment   Tan said in the earnings statement in September  There s little visibility due to the trade war and no sense of a  sharp recovery around the corner   he added on a conference call 
About half of the chips Broadcom sells are either used in China or sent through factories there on the way to becoming part of electronic devices sold around the world  Last year  Huawei accounted for about  900 million of Broadcom s sales  Tan has said  Broadcom stock  which has gained 24  this year to close yesterday at  315 06  has been lagging the benchmark semiconductor index 
Bottom Line
The company s shares have shown some resilience through the recent sluggish period for chipmakers  In our view  the effects of the Huawei ban and macroeconomic risks are well reflected in the current price  Any improvement in U S  China trade relations  or a possible deal that also involves Huawei  would be a big plus for Broadcom  In the meantime  investors watching tomorrow s earnings announcement should also focus on the company s view on 2020  cloud capex spending and smartphone unit trends ",2019-12-11,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/broadcom-earnings-preview-guidance-on-2020-chip-demand-will-be-crucial-200491687,200491687

325705,TGT,WRAPUP 1 Industry crumbling  joblessness up in E Europe,news,"  Czech Jan unemployment jumps to 6 8 pct  vs 6 0 pct in Dec
   Slovak industrial output slumps 16 8 pct yr yr
   Czech Jan inflation slows to 2 2 pct  near bottom of
central bank s target range
   Romanian 2008 trade gap grows 3 4 pct yr yr
 
 By Michael Winfrey
 PRAGUE  Feb 9  Reuters    The Czech jobless rate jumped by
almost a percentage point in January and Slovak industry showed
its worst contraction in a decade  as evaporating demand from
the euro zone batters ex communist central Europe 
 Some economists believed the Czechs may have followed
Hungary into recession last quarter and the situation is likely
to worsen as factories across the region slash tens of thousands
of jobs and cut hours  particularly in car and electronics
plants 
 Czech unemployment rose to a higher than expected 6 8
percent of the workforce in January  from 6 0 percent a month
earlier and 6 4 percent forecast by the Reuters poll 
  What we re seeing is a recession that has its roots in
manufacturing  I m pretty sure it will spread and engulf the
entire economy    including the retail and consumer side    over
the next six to 12 months   said Neil Shearing  an economist at
Capital Economics 
  The feed through will be into a deterioration in the labour
market  We ve already seen a jump in the Czech jobless rate and
I think that will continue and it could get to 10 percent quite
easily  
 Other data showed Czech inflation slowed to 2 2 percent in
January  near the bottom of the central bank s target range 
clearing the path for further interest rate cuts to underpin the
economy   ID nL9192673  
 
 INDUSTRY CRUMBLING
 The Czech central bank s 2009 annual inflation target is 3
percent  plus or minus 1 percentage point  and analysts said the
slowdown in price growth meant it would most likely continue
cutting rates from 1 75 percent now 
  More rate cuts towards 1 25 percent seem likely in the
coming months   said Vojtech Benda  senior economist at ING
Wholesale 
 Other data showed Slovak output fell by 16 8 percent
year on year in December  the sharpest fall in 10 years
 ID nL9212190  
 It was led by an 18 8 percent fall in manufacturing
production versus a year earlier  including a 35 7 percent fall
in production in the car industry  which makes up more than a
fifth of Slovakia s economy 
 Regional trade data out Monday showed that falls of up to 30
percent in emerging EU currencies against the euro since the
second half of 2008 have begun to unravel wide external
imbalances 
 But analysts said that while weaker currencies would help
trade deficits by making imports more expensive  the idea that
they would help the export dominant region climb out of
recession any time soon was misplaced 
 In Romania  where the leu has lost 17 percent against the
euro  data showed the 2008 trade deficit had grown by a modest
3 4 percent versus a year earlier  ID nL9243590    while in
Hungary  where the forint has lost 19 percent since the end of
July  the December trade deficit shrank 40 percent 
  Any idea that a weaker currency will somehow lead to an
export based recovery seems a bit far fetched when you ve got
demand everywhere in the world collapsing   Shearing said

276903,AAPL,The Fed s Wait And See Approach Smashes USD,opinion,"State Of Affairs In Financial Markets   Jan 31
The overarching theme dominating moves in financial markets is the dovish signal sent by the Fed on Wednesday  further acknowledging that rate hikes are no longer top of the list  with patience being reiterated  while also making the admission that a potential review of the balance sheet normalization guidance  The Fed has gone full circle from constructively hawkish just a few months to an undeniably dovish stance  When we look back years from now  the sequence of events that unfolded since the aggressive tightening of financial conditions in the U S  would be an excellent case study on how market forces  ultimately  will determine the course of action by a Central Bank 
In light of the dovish admissions by the Fed  the U S  dollar was absolutely smashed across the board as the DXY clearly shows in the chart below  Be mindful  this event has fundamental ramifications one can build upon to stay USD bearish for the near term  If you check the ratios of implied vs historical vols currently at play  we are faced with a market with a directional market profile in nature  which is the best environment for momentum strategies to thrive  when breaks occur  The sellers of puts must hedge their risk by selling breakouts and vice versa  hence limited gamma scalping

Risk assets also thrived in response to the Fed s message  with the S P 500 as the bellwether of U S  equities catching a strong bid  and most importantly  akin to the bearish moves in the USD  found acceptance near the highs of the day  The upbeat in earnings by tech giant Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  yesterday  alongside the better results by Boeing  NYSE BA   were underpinning factors for equities right off the bat  with the Fed being the accelerant  The dynamics have now re anchored to an environment characterized by USD weakness across the board in a context of risk appetite  The 5 DMA slope and cycles both point in the same direction  which means  the safest bet is to swim in the direction of the  risk on  currents 

source  Tradingview com
Other measures of risk exhibit an analogous sanguine outlook  For instance  the gold oil ratio keeps falling as a barometer of positive risk taking  the VIX is re visiting the lows of the year around 17 6  global equity markets are moving in tandem with the gains printed in the S P 500  emerging market currencies  assisted by the collapse in the U S  dollar  are too finding sufficient strength to keep the bid tone  which will undoubtedly ease the pressure amid mounting USD denominated debt burdens  Besides  within the EM FX basket  a USD CNY at 6 7 in a week where high level talks between the U S  and a Chinese delegation aimed to reach a compromise on trade is setting a positive stage  even if other issues such as Huawei s CFO extradition charges  etc  cast a shadow  Keep watching the performance of USD CNH as the best barometer of where the negotiations are headed 
We ve also entered a bull steepener dynamics in the U S  yield curve  This is an environment where short term yields drop faster than long term yields  and it communicates a potential rate cut down the road as the market factors in diminished expectations for economic growth combined with suppressed inflation  It s incredible how we ve transitions so swiftly from a bear steepener  where short term yields were rising faster than long term  which suggested the Fed was getting ahead of itself  to now see the Fed finally recognizing past mistakes  Listen to the market

Back to the FOMC statement  as it s interesting to scope out all the details that have effectively confirmed the 180 degree turnaround in the Fed s views  First off  the Fed removed its reference to further gradual rate changes from its statement  while the post official speeches noted that the Committee has pledged to be patient on further adjustments to the target range  Even Jerome Powell  on its press conference  gave us the admission that the case for a hike is somewhat weaker

This is a clear acknowledgment that no rate hikes are expected anytime soon  which could also be understood as a tweak that prepares the market for any eventuality  including a rate cut  as the bull steepener in the chart above harbingers  So  what has led the Fed to turn more prudent on its outlook  By now it should be a no brainer that it was the tightening of financial conditions from Q4  18  which again  was reflected by the statement noting  global economic and financial developments and muted inflationary pressures   If history is any indication  in the last 30y  every prolonged pause in a Fed rate hike cycle has led to an eventual easing campaign to combat recessions  Interestingly  which is a testament to the structurally weakening trend  every hiking cycle has reached a peak that was lower than the previous tightening campaign s peak 
The Fed  however  still sees a silver lining beyond the gloomier outlook by the state of the U S  economy  noting that it  continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity  strong labor market conditions  and inflation near the Committee s symmetric 2  objective   On his speech  Powell delivered a mixed bag outlook by noting  there is growing evidence of cross currents and patiently waiting for greater clarity has served policymakers well in the past   The market is now discounting a Fed s policy structure where no more hikes are expected through 2019 
But make no mistake  the above was just a reiteration of a familiar theme well discounted by the rise in risk assets  what really moved the needle was the acknowledgment that the Committee is  prepared to adjust  the details of its balance sheet normalization if the pre conditions are present  There was a passage in the statement that clearly strengthens the notion that this has now become a clear possibility going forward  by noting that  the Committee is revising its earlier guidance regarding the conditions under which it could adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization program   Whenever this happens  it s going to be a game changer as what was so feared  that is  the continuation of the liquidity drainage via QT  will come to an abrupt halt  which is a very bullish risk event for risk 
One of the currencies that benefited the most by the sell off in the U S  dollar was the Aussie  emboldened not only by a stronger than expected CPI reading  but also by a massive nearly 10  outlier rise in Iron ore  coupled with the convergence of global equities higher and a strong Yuan  The Aussie is setting up to experience heightened vol above its historical standards near term  On one hand  vol emanating from the US China trade negotiations this week will be key  But equally important is the update in monetary policies by the RBA when they meet next week after its holiday period  The clear negative feedback loop into the real Aussie economy from lower house prices has become more evident  which means the chances of a rate cut have gone up heading into Q2 Q3  19  The market is pricing over 70  chances of a cut in the next 12 months  which makes you wonder to what extent the market can justify further rises in the currency in anticipation of a potential Central Bank monetary policy divergence play in coming months  We ll get more clarity next week

The bullish outside days printed by volume rich currencies such as EUR or the JPY against the USD is further testament of the market intentions to extend the weakness in the latter  If we pay close attention  the pairs gather all the technical evidence one can possible get to join the momentum  from solid closes by NY cut out time  POCs trapped behind  moves not yet over extended judging by the slow stochastics  the slope of the 5 DMA in favour  correlations pointing in the same direction  The one discussion that EUR bulls won t probably come up victorious is the fundamental state of the European economy  The downgrade by the German economy ministry of its growth forecast for 2019 by a whopping 0 8  from 1 8  to 1  is a very gloomy prognosis of the turbulent waters ahead

The Sterling was the exception  lagging behind in terms of demand relative to the rest of peers  Where we stand right now in the Brexit mess  after the amendments votes this week  is as complicated as it ever was  as the EC is not backing off from its hard line stance on the Irish backstop and that a deal will not be re negotiated  even if it has become clearer that U K  politicians won t allow a  Hard Brexit   which makes the prospects of an Article 50 extension not a distant possibility  In terms of price action  even if Tuesday s commanding bearish bar may trump traders  confidence to join the trend  similar to the rest of FX  the technical outlook remains sanguine  with correlation in alignment

325623,CPB,Dean Foods Hits 52 Week Low  Soft Volumes   Input Costs Hurt,opinion,Shares of Dean Foods Company   NYSE DF   touched a 52 week low of  3 89  before closing the session a tad higher at  3 93 on Dec 21  Notably  the company has long been grappling with escalated fuel  freight and resin costs  which along with volatility surrounding fluid milk volumes has been hurting its performance In third quarter 2018  the company reported disappointing results  wherein both top and bottom line deteriorated year over year due to soft volumes stemming from plant closures and associated transitionary costs  These cost hurdles are expected to persist  which compelled management to slash its earnings outlook for 2018   Read   Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been witnessing a downtrend  We note that estimates for current and next year have moved south by 18 cents and 17 cents to a loss of 24 cents and a loss of 5 cents  respectively  over the past 30 days Clearly  these downsides have hurt investors  confidence in the stock that has crashed 34 5  since the announcement of the results on Nov 7  In the past three months  shares of this Texas based company have plunged around 47   wider than the  s decline of 41 5   Currently  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock carries a  of D  That said  let s take a closer look at the aspects impacting the company s performance  You can see  Input Cost and Soft Volumes  A ConcernDean Foods is battling significant input cost inflation  Evidently  increased resin  freight and fuel expenses have been hurting the company s margins for a while and also remained a worry in the third quarter of 2018  Companies like Conagra Brands   NYSE CAG    TreeHouse Foods   NYSE THS   and Campbell Soup   NYSE CPB   among others are also bearing the brunt of rising input costs  Coming back to Dean Foods  a tight labor market due to limited driver availability dented margins These factors along with higher transitory costs related to plant closures and increased advertising expenses weighed on Dean Foods  third quarter results  While adjusted gross margin contracted 250 basis points  the company posted an adjusted operating loss of  20 million  Management stated that fuel rates flared up 25  year to date and is expected to remain high through the final quarter Moreover  the company has been witnessing lower volumes and loss of share in U S  fluid milk volumes for a while now  During the third quarter  volumes declined significantly year over year  largely due to the closure of seven plants  Further  per USDA results  fluid milk category dropped 2  through August on a quarter to date basis  Soft volumes and escalated transitory costs too affected Dean Foods  adjusted gross profit and the bottom line   These volume losses are expected to linger in the fourth quarter  which remains a concern Will Cost Cutting Plans Provide Respite to Stock Dean Foods is focused on reducing unnecessary costs throughout the organization and improving efficiency  It is particularly paying attention toward the improvement of waste management and operating efficiency  Under the OPEX 2020 cost productivity plan introduced in 2017  the company had targeted annual productivity of  80  100 million  These savings are likely to provide some cushion against input cost inflation and volume deleverage throughout its operational phase Further  the company is on track with its plans to boost operational excellence via execution of the enterprise wide cost productivity program in order to generate additional savings in 2018 and beyond  This productivity program mainly revolves around three major areas including enhancement of its supply chain network  optimizing spending across all key categories to ensure greater efficiency and integration of operating model along with minimizing general and administrative expenses  Meanwhile  the enhancement of supply chain focuses on consolidating plant network and maintaining quality  value and service Moreover  Dean Foods is implementing plans to alleviate headwinds related to high freight and fuel expenses  while continuing to boost its brands and private label business to fuel volumes  Notably  the cost productivity program is likely to deliver an incremental annual run rate savings of  150 million by 2020  These initiatives should help the company offset some negative impacts from volume declines and higher non dairy input costs However  the company does not expect the cost woes to be completely countered by the end of this year  This is also reflected in management s lowered outlook for 2018  That said  the current hurdles keep us apprehensive about the stock Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside

 NEW YORK  Aug 18  Reuters    U S  stocks rose on Tuesday 
rebounding after sharp losses in the previous session  as
better than expected results from big retailers encouraged

436962,WMB,Trump Attacks on Fed Could Backfire  Boosting Powell s Support,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump s attacks on the Federal Reserve may hold a silver lining for Chairman Jerome Powell  preserving unity among colleagues who can sometimes go rogue 
America s central bankers have a strong culture of closing ranks during times of strain to defend the chair and preserve institutional independence  Even though there s an argument for holding interest rates steady  Trump s pressure may make any dissent less likely at the Dec  18 19 meeting when a fourth quarter point increase this year is widely expected 
 FOMC members will stand behind Powell   said William Poole  former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis  who regularly dissented at meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee during a 10 year term ending in 2008   There is a powerful culture of an independent Fed  and policy makers will want  to avoid any hint of siding with Trump  
Trump renewed his criticism on Thursday in an interview with Fox News   Hopefully the Fed won t be raising interest rates anymore   he said   I m almost at a normalized interest rate and yet our economy is soaring   He s been criticizing Powell in tweets and public comments for months  accusing the central bank of undermining economic growth by hiking rates Powell has encountered no dissents since becoming chairman in February  By contrast  22 dissenting votes were cast against his predecessor Janet Yellen over four years  and 48 against Ben Bernanke over eight years  Both periods were intensely challenging for officials as they battled the Great Recession and its after effects  spurring a spirited debate over the correct policy response 
Fed presidents have dismissed Trump s criticism  saying higher rates are based on data and analysis  New York Fed President John Williams  NYSE WMB  said on Dec  12  he is committed to  making the tough calls   The Atlanta Fed s Raphael Bostic said in October that  we have to do what we think is best  
Bostic has been seen as a possible dissenter next week  He pledged in August that he wouldn t vote for anything that would knowingly invert the yield curve    that is  raise short term bond yields above longer term ones  which some see as a signal of a coming recession  With 10 year yields already close to the 2 year equivalents  inversion is an imminent risk if the Fed raises rates again 
St  Louis s James Bullard  the most dovish participant on the FOMC based on his recommendation to keep rates on hold for several years  becomes a voter in 2019 in the annual rotation among regional bank chiefs 
Also voting next year will be Chicago Fed s Charles Evans  a past dove who s moved to the center as the job market has tightened  and Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston s Eric Rosengren  who have been hawkish in recent years 
Sooner or later  someone will almost certainly break ranks under Powell  The last chairman to serve without dissents was Thomas McCabe  whose term ended in 1951  Still  three or more  no  votes at a single meeting might give the impression of a divided central bank 
Fed chairs  while publicly embracing dissents  have tried behind the scenes to head them off  Bernanke  in his memoir  The Courage to Act   recounted his conversations and calls with various Fed presidents and governors before critical meetings  as he sought to drum up votes  He described his gratitude after Governor Kevin Warsh voted in favor of a second massive round of Fed bond purchases in 2010  despite strong personal qualms 
A sense of responsibility to support the chairman also weighs on committee members  who have on occasion initially dissented and then put aside their objections to show support  said Dennis Lockhart  a retired Atlanta Fed president who never dissented 
There s a  strong impulse  to show consensus  said Lockhart   Committee members will vote what each really thinks is the right policy  but if on the fence  might lean away from a dissent  
They re even more likely to do so when they re under external attack  said Princeton University economist Alan Blinder  a former Fed vice chairman 
 Would be dissenters may pull their punches when the criticism is coming from the White House or Congress   he said ",2018-12-13,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trump-attacks-on-fed-could-backfire-boosting-powells-support-1721081,1721081

236470,HP,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Diamond Offshore  Noble  Helmerich   Payne  Independence Contract And Transocean,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  September 27  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc    NYSE DO    Noble Corp  plc   NYSE NE    Helmerich   Payne  Inc    NYSE HP    Independence Contract Drilling  Inc    NYSE ICD   and Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Drilling Industry Continues to Suffer  Is Relief in Sight The drilling industry has witnessed a significant downfall in the last few quarters  With WTI Crude price struggling to stay above the  60 per barrel mark for a sustained period  drilling companies are experiencing a slow pace of recovery  This lean period forced drillers to cut costs to a bare minimum  and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil and gas  Impressively  they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques  While this has improved profit levels to an extent  the sentiment around the industry still remains mostly negative Industry Performance Let s take a look at the price performance of the oil and gas drilling industry  In the past year  the S P 500 Index has improved 2 3  against the oil and gas energy sector s 23  slump  During this period  the  plunged a whopping 55 7   Moreover  the industry currently ranks in the bottom 26  of the Zacks Industry Rank Headwinds Plaguing the IndustryExplorers and producers kick started 2019 with a conservative capital budget as they witnessed massive crude downturn during the fourth quarter of 2018  Moreover  explorers are more bothered about bottom line growth   being forced by investors following years of dull returns   than oil and gas production  Hence  conservative spending by upstream companies is likely to hurt demand for drilling services Environmental groups are pushing politicians to take necessary regulatory steps to reduce hydrocarbon consumption  Recently  the United States House of Representatives passed two bills  which ban new offshore oil and gas drilling in the Pacific and Atlantic coasts  Several environmental groups are lobbying the United States Senate to follow suit  Notably  in Europe  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar pledged to phase out oil exploration in the country s territorial waters Low oil price  triggered by a dampening global demand outlook and oversupplied market  had kept a lid on upstream projects  Especially in the offshore drilling scenario  low crude prices delayed final investment decisions for several major projects  Decreasing cost of production   attributed to operating efficiency gain   is helping the industry to recover but slowly  The situation had led to lower revenues for many offshore drillers including Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc   Noble Corp  plc and others  While Diamond Offshore s revenues decreased for eight consecutive years  we saw Noble Corp  s top line decline seven times in the last decade Downward Estimate RevisionsDue to the reasons stated above  the drilling industry has witnessed negative earnings estimate revisions by brokers  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 and 2020 has been revised downward Weakness in the drilling industry is haunting the companies that are part of it  including Helmerich   Payne  Inc   Independence Contract Drilling  Inc  and others  Both these companies currently have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  You can see  ConclusionThe players in the drilling industry are now focusing more on cost reduction  technological improvements and efficiency gains  Major drillers are cold stacking their relatively older rigs and pushing forward high end ones to boost margins  Companies like Transocean Ltd   given technologically advanced and versatile drilling fleet  are leading the course of the industry  Systematic and strategic plan of action can drive long term growth for the drillers Looking

Additionally  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  data shows that  13 7 billion has been invested in Europe funds It s been quite a turnaround after investors shunned the continent for an extended period due to multiple factors  These include the French election  Brexit and the economic crisis in Greece  However  a resilient economy and strong earnings performance seems to have turned the tide  Most analysts brush aside valuation related fears and believe earnings growth will continue to power stocks Economic Rebound Exceeds ExpectationsGermany led Europe s strong economic performance last month  helping the IHS Markit s final composite PMI for May maintain its level of 56 8  For Germany  business activity increased to a six year high of 57 4  Meanwhile  the entire region held on to its level for April  which is the highest since 2011  According to IHS Markit  Germany and France were driving growth for the entire region Additionally  Markit says that its data implies that GDP had increased by 0 7  in the second quarter  This is higher than the European Commission s official statistics agency Eurostat s projection of 0 5   Of course  this projection is likely to move higher given the significant upward revisions experienced by Greece and Italy next week   Meanwhile  unemployment has declined to 9 3   its lowest level since 2009  Markit now thinks several other growth projections for the Eurozone will also be revised upward  Growth for the Eurozone was twice as much as that of the U S  in the first quarter  Political  ECB Related Risks OverstatedEven as U S  stocks continue to hover near record levels  a large swathe of market watchers think that benchmarks will only experience moderate gains in the months ahead  In their opinion  better investment opportunities exist across the pond  Macron s victory in the French elections has already reduced political risk to a great extent  And even though Theresa May s lead is slipping according to recent opinion polls  she is still tipped to win parliamentary elections Coming to the ECB  even though the Eurozone s central bank is slated to tighten monetary conditions or at least hint at doing so in the near term  the associated risk has been overstated  Even if the ECB was to begin the process of rolling back monetary stimulus  it would be some time before the rates turn normal  Additionally  a switch from negative to positive rates would greatly aid banks  who make up a large chunk of the region s market Our ChoicesA close analysis of events in Europe reveals that political and economic risks have been overstated  Moreover  growth in the Eurozone has been proceeding at a considerably higher pace compared to the U S  Investors have also sought out European equities for their strong earnings growth and reasonable valuations Adding European stocks to your portfolio makes for a smart option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score We have narrowed down our search to the

370761,AMGN,Court Ruling Topples Trump Order  No Price Display In TV Ads,opinion,The pharma and the biotech sector gave investors a reason to cheer for when it received a welcoming news on Monday  A federal court passed a judgement in favour of the healthcare companies against the Trump administration in relation to drug pricing Per the ruling  pharmaceutical companies need not disclose the wholesale prices of their drugs in television advertising  The verdict comes as a blow to the US government s crackdown on drug pricing A judge in the United States District Court in the District of Columbia sentenced in support of Merck   NYSE MRK    Eli Lilly   NYSE LLY   and Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   determining that the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  cannot compel pharma companies to reveal the wholesale acquisition cost of drugs in adverts  The companies argued that many patients subscribe to health insurance policies that lower the prices they pay for the required drugs Last October  the Trump administration determined that drug makers should mention the prices of drugs in television commercials that cost more than  35 a month  This proposal was a step forward by the government to regulate the rising drug prices as a high list price would act as a deterrent The rule was scheduled to be effective Jul 9  2019 However  the federal judge pronounced that the HHS cannot impose any such rule as it lacked authority from the U S  Congress Drug pricing has been an overhang on the industry for long  The Trump government has been putting pressure on the pharma and biotech companies for quite some time through various means to lower the exorbitant prices of drugs and make healthcare affordable  The authorities had earlier proposed to do away with the drug rebates granted to middlemen and make the whole system more transparent Spending on drugs has reached an all time high in recent times due to cost intensive specialty drugs for complex conditions Earlier  companies like Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   were under scrutiny for the high costs of its blockbuster HCV drugs  Most recently  even Sanofi   NASDAQ SNY    Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk   NYSE NVO   were under vigilance on account of the staggering prices of insulin drugs  Even generic companies like Teva   NYSE TEVA   and Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  are on the radar for quoting inflated prices of generic drugs While all governments vow to go for a clampdown on high drug prices and make healthcare reasonable  little has been done in this regard  Meanwhile  the pharma and biotech companies contend the high research   development costs that bump up the prices of prescription drugs  Given the slowdown in growth of legacy drugs  most companies resort to hiking the prices of drugs to combat low volume growth We expect this contentious issue to persist as a headwind to the industry for a while now Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases Zacks has just released Century of Biology  7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance  Our recent biotech recommendations have produced gains of  98    119  and  164  in as little as 1 month  The stocks in this report could perform even better ,2019-07-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/court-ruling-topples-trump-order-no-price-display-in-tv-ads-200438570,200438570
415959,MMM,CR Or MMM  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Diversified Operations stocks have likely encountered both Crane  CR  and 3M  MMM   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Crane and 3M are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold  respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that CR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CR currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 77  while MMM has a forward P E of 18 92  We also note that CR has a PEG ratio of 1 43  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  MMM currently has a PEG ratio of 1 86 
Another notable valuation metric for CR is its P B ratio of 3 42  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  MMM has a P B of 10 61 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CR s Value grade of B and MMM s Value grade of D 
CR has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MMM  so it seems like value investors will conclude that CR is the superior option right now ",2018-06-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cr-or-mmm-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200321383,200321383

298715,MSFT,Microsoft Important Lessons In Valuation  Part 1,opinion,"Introduction
Before I get too deep into this article  I want to start out by stating that Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  has long been one of my favorite companies   Many years ago  I invested in Microsoft as a pure growth stock and sold it in 2000 when it became dangerous overvalued after making a very healthy long term profit   However  I did stay out of Microsoft until October 2011 when I then invested in it as a high quality dividend growth stock 
Thereafter  I held the stock until January 30  2017 where I once again sold it based on what I considered dangerous overvaluation   Admittedly  I did leave a lot of capital gain on the table since 2017   However  I averaged over 20  a year   including dividends   and achieved those results at what I perceived to be very low risk   Frankly  I never regret  nor do I apologize for earning a 20  annualized rate of return over a five year period 
This is the fourth article that I have presented on Microsoft   My first article was written on September 26  2010 and it was titled  After A Lost Decade  Is Microsoft A Buy    The comments I received on that article were quite negative regarding Microsoft  and consequently not real flattering to yours truly 
However  this was an interesting time because Microsoft grew earnings from fiscal year June 2000 to fiscal year end June 2010 at a rate exceeding 11  per annum   Microsoft also initiated a dividend in 2003 and grew that dividend at an average growth rate of 36  from 2003 through 2011   This was rather remarkable operating performance   Nevertheless  in 2010 investors were sour on the company because Microsoft had only generated a total annualized rate of return of 1 4  over that timeframe which was referred to as the lost decade 
Of course  the logical question would be how investment results could be so lousy  while operating performance and dividend growth were so spectacular   As a regular reader of my work  if you had not already guessed  the answer is simple and straightforward   In 2000 and 2001 the market was valuing Microsoft shares at dangerous overvaluation levels   Consequently  even though the company did well  great even  investors fared rather poorly   Clearly  valuation matters  and it matters a lot   Later in the following analyze out loud video I will clearly illustrate and elaborate on this 
My second Microsoft article was published on November 16  2012 titled    Once again  I received mostly negative comments suggesting that Microsoft was a dog  and valuation  undervaluation at the time  was in the eyes of the beholder  and as one comment put it  not on the balance sheet    What I want the reader to recognize is that from my first article in 2010 to my second article in 2012  Microsoft was trading at a normal P E ratio of approximately 10   The stock was undervalued on both occasions  but people hated it regardless 
Then on July 20  2018 I published my third article on Microsoft warning investors that the stock had now become excessively valued   This article was titled     Once again  I was severely chastised for suggesting that Microsoft   now the superstar  was overvalued   This criticism has continued to this day  because the stock is up approximately 34  since I published that third article warning about overvaluation 
However  I want to take this opportunity to point out that the time that has passed from my third article has not yet reached long term status yet   On the other hand  the time that has passed from my initial two articles have clearly passed the definition of long term   I feel this is important because I only present long term ideas   I have suggested many times in the past that neither I nor anyone else can time the market over the short run  
Furthermore  even though my first two articles have reached long term status  and the results have been excellent  it took my first article more than two years  which still qualifies as short term  to see any meaningful profit had you invested in Microsoft after I wrote the article 
The reason I present this is neither to brag nor to defend my past work   My reason for bringing this up today is to attempt to illustrate just how important valuation truly is to long term investor returns   Ironically  in all three previous cases I was told in comments on both articles that valuation was in the eyes of the beholder   In contrast  my stance has been  and remains today  that valuation is a mathematical principle and should never be ignored or overlooked by shareholders   Valuation does not always have an immediate impact  but in my personal experience spanning five decades  valuation will always have a significant long term impact   either good or bad   depending on whether valuation is low or high initially 
The meat  and I daresay the heart and soul of this article will be presented in this video   Consequently  I encourage the reader to please take the time to watch the video carefully  and with an open mind   This company  Microsoft  is a very interesting case study because it teaches us very important lessons on valuation  I believe these lessons are critically important for investors to recognize and understand if they expect to be successful investing in common stocks over the long run   Therefore  in the video  I will be evaluating Microsoft utilizing several widely utilized and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
So  with all due respect  if you don t carefully watch this video  then I would ask that you don t bother to comment on this article   Moreover  to soften my stance a little  I believe you will also find the video illuminating and fascinating 
Summary and Conclusions
Valuation is first and foremost a measurement of long term risk   Valuation is not a short term market timing tool   Intelligent investors understand that in the short run the market is a  voting machine  and as such likely to price stocks at ludicrous levels   However  in the long run the market is a  weighing machine  where fundamentals inevitably rule the day   Consequently  investors are very wise  and will be well rewarded in the long run by paying attention to fundamentals whether they are buying  holding or deciding to sell their common stock holdings 
Finally  valuation is not in the eyes of the beholder as some people believe   Instead  valuation is a function of properly discounting money flows  earnings and or cash flows  back to the present value   In this regard  valuation is based on sound mathematical principles of business  economics and accounting   In Part 2 of this miniseries I will elaborate on the mathematics underpinning valuation ",2019-08-07,Chuck Carnevale,https://www.investing.com/analysis/microsoft-important-lessons-in-valuation-part-1-200452015,200452015
397808,PEP,PepsiCo  PEP  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q2 Release,opinion,"PepsiCo  PEP  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 9  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This food and beverage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 49 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 5  
Revenues are expected to be  16 39 billion  up 1 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 22  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PepsiCo 
For PepsiCo  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 17  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that PepsiCo will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PepsiCo would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 97  delivering a surprise of  5 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
PepsiCo appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pepsico-pep-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q2-release-200436508,200436508

Margin TrendsGross margin in the quarter under review expanded 20 basis points  bps  to 78 8   According to management  this improvement in gross margin can be attributed to improved efficiencies in

366697,STT,The Safest Banks To Buy,opinion,"Investing in the safest banks has historically been very lucrative 
They have high returns on equity  and can dig economic moats around their businesses in the form of high switching costs  Changing banks is a hassle  and most consumers don t bother to take out assets even if they find a competitor that offers slightly better rates 
Except for large conglomerates and investment banks  banking is a simple business  They borrow money at a very low rate through deposits  and lend money at a higher rate to people who need mortgage loans  personal loans  auto loans  student loans  and lines of credit  For a well managed bank  it s not too hard to keep their deposit balance going up each year  which allows for consistent annual growth 
In fact  Warren Buffett made most of his fortune by investing in banks and insurance companies 
But all investors today should remember the financial crisis for the rest of their investing careers  The recession threw institutions that were once thought to be nearly invincible into sudden insolvency  And residential real estate  the asset class that as once thought to be extraordinarily safe  crashed  Even the most well run banks cut their dividends and hunkered down for survival 
But those most well run banks survived  and eventually flourished during the recovery  giving shareholders great returns over the past decade despite the financial crisis occurring during the period 
The U S  Federal Reserve now stress tests all of the largest banks to ensure that they are well capitalized  And see if they are able to survive a recession even more severe than the one that we went through in 2008  They force banks to use less leverage than they did before  and most banks take it upon themselves to have stricter underwriting standards for their loans and take risk more seriously 
June 2017 Stress Test Results
In June  the Federal Reserve released this year s stress test report  and for the first time  all 34 banks on their list passed  Only one bank  Capital One  NYSE COF   was given  conditional  approval  and the rest were given a full green light 
The report breaks down the results of each bank  so if you re bank investor  it s a must read  They simulate an extremely severe recession  and model the impact on each bank to see if they would remain solvent and able to continue to lend even through the darkest times 
Specifically  these are the economic conditions they use 
The unemployment rate goes up to 10 
GDP falls by 6 5  from its pre recession peak
Equity prices fall 50 
Residential real estate prices fall 25 
Commercial real estate prices fall 35 
International developed markets face severe economic recessions as well
Probably the most useful chart in the report is this one 

Source  Dodd Frank Act Stress Test  June 2017
This chart shows the percentage of their total loans that each bank is expected to lose under such a severe scenario 
Discover  NYSE DFS   Capital One  NYSE COF  and American Express  NYSE AXP  have the highest expected loss rates  You might assume it s due to poor underwriting standards  but that s actually not the case  In particular  American Express and Discover are among the most conservative underwriters compared to their peers 
Instead  the divergence among banks is mostly due to the type of lending they do 
American Express and Discover are the most heavily focused on credit card lending  Credit cards have the highest loss rates during recessions  Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   on the other hand  is heavily in the mortgage space  which is less volatile and less prone to losses 
The most pure play custodian banks such as State Street  NYSE STT  and Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK   commonly called BNY Mellon  have the lowest expected loan loss rates and hardly any expected absolute loan losses at all  This is because they don t participate in normal consumer banking like most other ones on the list do 
The Safest Banks Come At A Price Premium
There s no free lunch  and the banks with the lowest expected loan losses tend to command the highest valuations on their stocks  as measured by the price to earnings  P E  ratio 
State Street and BNY Mellon have P E ratios of about 17 and 16  respectively 
U S  Bancorp  NYSE USB  and Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB  have P E ratios of 16 and 14 
Capital One and Discover have P E ratios of under 13 and 11 
The pure play custodial banks and the most diversified large banks  especially U S  Bancorp  have the highest credit ratings as well 
Since all 34 banks passed the stress test  they all have enough equity to withstand the expected loan losses  at least according to the Federal Reserve 
For example  American Express has the third highest percentage of expected loan losses  It s estimated to lose almost  11 billion worth of loans in this severe scenario  But they have almost  21 billion in equity to absorb that potential hit 
The banks with the higher expected loan losses tend to have less leverage  because they need that extra capital to cushion their more volatile lending activities  This is how  for example  Discover managed to remain solvent during the financial collapse despite being an almost pure play credit card lender 
All 34 banks on the list are considered well capitalized against foreseeable risks  but for some of them a recession would give them a bumpier ride as big chunks of their equity get cut away by loan losses  American Express and Discover have had rather bearish performance over the last few years  both of them currently have a stock price lower than they had in 2014  Investing in some of the more volatile picks takes a bit of a contrarian mindset  but both of them are rather attractively priced at the moment 
When you re looking for a bank to invest in  the key question to ask yourself is what degree of volatility and uncertainty you re willing to handle  An aggressive lender like Capital One is fairly diverse  but still has substantial credit card exposure and uses some of the loosest lending standards with high net loan charge offs  American Express and Discover are the most focused on credit cards  but maintain strict underwriting standards 
Some banks  like the custodial pure plays and the banks that are both diversified and conservative  like U S  Bancorp  are expected to be the safest and least volatile  but may offer lower total returns in exchange for that safety

285179,AAPL,Natural Gas Drops Sharply Amid Irma Stoked Demand Worries,opinion,"The U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed an above average increase in natural gas supplies following which the commodity traded down  Worries over the fuel s tepid demand on the back of Hurricane Irma related power outages further pushed down natural gas prices 
About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report
The Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report   brought out by the Energy Information Administration  EIA  every Thursday since 2002   includes updates on natural gas market prices  the latest storage level estimates  recent weather data and other market activities or events 
The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of natural gas  It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas weighted companies and related support plays 
Analysis of the Data  In Line Rise in Storage
Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 65 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended Sep 1  2017  at par with the guidance as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts  a leading independent commodities and energy data provider 
However  the increase was higher than both last year s addition of 38 Bcf and the 5 year  2012 2016  average net injection of 58 Bcf for the reported week  This caused the current storage level   at 3 220 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    to slightly widen its surplus to the five year average to 15 Bcf  0 5    while stocks are still 212 Bcf  6 2   below the year ago figure 
The largely unsupportive data prompted natural gas prices to fall 1 9 cents  or 0 6   to  2 981 per MMBtu on Thursday 
Fundamentally speaking  supply rose 2 3  on a weekly basis to 79 Bcf per day  while daily natural gas consumption declined 1 5  to 66 5 Bcf  The increase in supply could be attributed to higher dry natural gas production  On the demand side  the fall was triggered by sharply lower residential and commercial consumption  Meanwhile  Mexican gas exports were up some 5 1  to inch up closer to pre Hurricane Harvey levels 
Prices Suffer From Irma Impact 
The aftermath of Hurricane Irma also weighed on natural gas prices 
With the storm cutting off electricity to at least 4 5 million customers in Florida  power and manufacturing sector consumption will be depressed for the next several days  The big storm has also brought cool temperatures to the region  limiting air conditioning demand  This prompted natural gas to end down 5 9  for the week to  2 89 per MMBtu 
Further  Irma induced demand losses   following on the heels of Hurricane Harvey s disruptions   are set to translate into big storage builds over the coming weeks  extending the two year old supply glut and pressurizing prices 
The perceived short term price weakness from the above factors might negatively impact natural gas heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc    NYSE RICE    Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK    Southwestern Energy Co    NYSE SWN    WPX Energy Inc    NYSE WPX    Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG   and EQT Corp    NYSE EQT    
Positive Long Term Thesis
Despite occasional hiccups  long term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances  While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year  the growing use of liquefied natural gas  or LNG   booming LNG and Mexican exports  replacing coal fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output  The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the five year average in the near future  with deficits piling up later on  Over time  these secular tailwinds are likely to support natural gas sentiment and price

352731,EXPE,Expedia to expand U S  passenger rail booking presence  CEO,news,"By Sophia Kunthara
 Reuters    Online travel provider  Expedia  Inc  NASDAQ EXPE  is looking to build up its rail booking services in the United States  Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday 
The Bellevue  Washington based company  which offers online bookings of hotels  flights and cars for travelers  is working to expand those capabilities to passenger train service on a global basis  Khosrowshahi said  looking to key markets like Europe  where it has already started offering rail bookings in the United Kingdom and Germany 
 Rail in Europe is incredibly important as far as a transportation medium   Khosrowshahi said in an interview   It s becoming increasingly important in the Asia Pacific markets  And I think in the U S   rail isn t quite as strong  but we are certainly building up infrastructure on the back end to be able to expand our rail offering on a global basis  
Plans for expanding its U S  rail booking options are in the early stages  Khosrowshahi said  declining to provide further details 
In June  the company acquired a majority stake in SilverRail Technologies Inc  an unlisted retailing and distribution platform for rail  at an undisclosed price 
Although SilverRail is based in London  Expedia actually began partnering with the firm in 2010 for its corporate travel brand  Egencia  to provide rail options in the United States  where nearly all long distance passenger train service is provided by U S  government owned Amtrak 
 With all the talk about being environmentally friendly  you know we do think it is a good way for people to get around  it s a good transport mechanism and it s one that we want to promote   Khosrowshahi said

270736,AAPL,Why Apple Stock Is A Bargain Now,opinion,"Millions of investors believe that they have to search for the one stock in thousands that s relatively unknown  And they ve been led to believe that the cheaper it is  the better 
Not so 
The real way to make money from stocks is much different  But you might not hear much about it  because Wall Street doesn t want you to know it 
In fact  Wall Street wants you to drop good stocks like a hot potato  so they can pick  em up and ride into the sunset with your money in their pockets 
Today  I ll show you what Wall Street won t  so you ll know how to make the kind of profits that will grow into substantial wealth 
Finding the Right Stock with the Right  Stuff 
The real key to investing is not finding the one unknown stock that can shoot your portfolio into the stratosphere  It s about buying large scale companies connected to one or more of the six Unstoppable Trends we talk about frequently 
Not only are they tapped into trillions  but they can continue to grow exponentially for decades to come 
When you own companies like that  you don t have to sell when they hit new highs   but Wall Street tells you otherwise 
Apple 
The company is a cash cow  and contrary to what a lot of folks want to believe  it s just beginning to hit its stride 
The company has a deep  competitive moat    a term Warren Buffett likes to use to describe a company s ability to remain competitive   and with an estimated 1 5 billion devices out there  that s something that won t go away anytime soon 

Apple s  NASDAQ AAPL  got a huge customer base of 1 5 billion  super customers  who want damn near everything the company produces and who will spare no expense buying  phones  watches  subscriptions  services  and more 
Profit margins are routinely above 20   which means the company produces  712 million in sales a day if my quick back of the envelope calculations are in the neighborhood 
According to CEO Tim Cook  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  may control as much as  313 billion of the healthcare data market within the next seven years 

My point is that Apple is a bargain at  317 a share 
In fact  I think it ll hit  400 by the end of this year  which is saying something  considering I told you it would double to  300 the same time last year  and it did 
Of course  Wall Street is telling you otherwise 
This Market Won t Wait Around for YouHere s the thing 
This is a market where there s no time to go slow 
You have to be  in to win   or you won t win 
It s really that simple 

Wall Street wants you to believe Apple is old news  and the pre earnings reports about how the company will miss earnings  or sell only so many iPhones  are already starting to trickle across the Internet 
They re wanting you to sell or give up hope   if you haven t already   because that s how they clear the decks for themselves  by making you think this is complicated  That way  you ll need their  guidance  
What a load of nonsense 

Case in point  Analysts expect consensus earnings per share of  4 53 when Apple  reports on Jan  28  and   to my point   they ve been wrong for a long time  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  has beaten revenue and earnings estimates for the past four quarters and has a long history of  surprising  the Street to the upside 
I think the number tops  4 80  or possibly even  5 a share 
The time is NOW 
Missing out is simply something you don t want to do 

I believe short sellers  perma bears  and folks who just can t move beyond the whole iPhone thing are going to pooh pooh Apple leading into earnings  Their goal is to create a downdraft by convincing the weak money to sell 

That s a perfect opportunity to pick up shares  I suggest you go hunting in the  300 per share arena   as in buy shares for  300 or less 

Or consider using the same dip to sell a  bullish put spread   which is a combination of options that will profit when Apple resumes its march higher  but strictly limits your risk in the meantime if it doesn t or I am completely wrong  which is possible  

This takes far less capital to do  gives you a degree of control  and keeps risk to razor thin levels   which I like a lot at a time when the markets are overdue for a short term pullback generally speaking  never mind our discussion on Apple today 

In the meantime  if you re eager to trade Apple  you could use the same dip to buy just a few shares of Apple stock and potentially make out like a proverbial bandit  Many investors don t think this is  worth it  and tell me they d rather have Apple s latest and greatest iPhone  iPad  or Apple Watch because  at least they ll get to use it  
Talk about shortsighted 

Let s crunch some numbers  An original iPod would have set you back  399 at the time  But had you plowed that  399 into Apple  you d be sitting on a staggering  93 222 in Apple stock today 

Apple does a fabulous job with its money ",2020-01-26,Keith Fitz-Gerald,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-apple-stock-is-a-bargain-now-200501611,200501611

259963,BAC,Wall Street Wonders Whether Trump s Tariff Is a Tactic  Or Not ,news," Bloomberg     Policy analysts are offering a variety of interpretations of President Trump s latest tariff threat  Some  like Goldman and Citi  are optimistic a U S  China deal can still be reached  Others  including Raymond James and Cowen  are more cautious  warning the process may have been derailed  and point to rising global risks 
Investors weren t happy about the news  with S P 500 futures lower by about 50 points  Tech and machinery companies were particularly hard hit  with  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group  Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL    Boeing  NYSE BA  Co  and  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   all sliding  Bellwether banks such as Bank of America Corp  NYSE BAC     Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   and JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   were all lower pre market 
Here s a sample of what analysts are saying 
Goldman  Alec Phillips
Goldman believes a tariff increase may be  narrowly avoided   putting odds that tariffs rise on Friday at 40 percent  Phillips wrote in a note 
Will be watching whether a large delegation of Chinese officials comes to Washington on May 8  as scheduled  canceling would mean an agreement in the coming week would  seem very unlikely   and would make an increase in the tariff rate to 25 percent  the base case  
China trade issues have  negative implications for the outlook for auto tariffs and passage of the USMCA  U S  Mexico Canada Agreement    Trump s  willingness to risk a market disruption by threatening an unexpected tariff hike suggests that he might also be willing to risk the disruption that formally proposing auto tariffs or announcing the intent to withdraw from NAFTA might cause   Phillips raised the probability that auto tariffs will be implemented later this year to 20 percent from 10 percent  and lowered the probability that USMCA will pass to 60 percent from 70 percent 
Citi  Cesar Rojas
 Cautiously optimistic  on a U S  China trade deal in the second quarter  though tariff threats will likely  remain as a way to get concessions from China and to enforce the agreement   Rojas wrote in a note 
Rojas had expected that as the Chinese economy stabilized   China would be less willing to provide additional concessions to the U S   The new threat is  consistent with the U S  adding more pressure on China to get these concessions   The Trump administration  pays attention to equity markets   which means stocks diving could lead to a retreat from implementing the tariffs threat 
Even so  he continues to believe  uncertainty is likely to remain high as the tariffs threat remains in place and second round effects from a reallocation of global trade remain underestimated  
RBC  Lori Calvasina
A trade deal with China has been widely anticipated by investors  and was a  key contributor to the early 2019 rally in US equities   Calvasina wrote in a note 
That means the weekend s developments were a negative catalyst for the market not only because of investor sentiment  but also  because of the downward earnings revisions that are likely to occur if the tariffs are expanded  
Sees  these steps backwards on the trade deal with China as particularly negative  for industrial and semiconductor companies 
Raymond James  Ed Mills
 The progress towards a U S  China deal has been up ended with renewed tariff threats by President Trump     apparent balks by the Chinese  especially on tech transfers   and the threat of the Chinese delegation canceling this week s round of negotiations   Mills wrote in a note 
Conversations with Raymond James s trade contacts point to  a universal belief that this is not negotiating leverage  but what was almost a done deal last week  has derailed in recent days  There is some hope that negotiations could be salvaged  but this situation highlights how tenuous any U S  China deal remains  
Contacts have revealed questions about  what led to the latest breakdown  and whether developments related to Venezuela  the Iran oil sanctions decision  North Korea s weekend missile test  or lessening worry about the economic conditions in both the U S  and China influenced the direction   Geopolitical volatility spiking in recent weeks may signal   a more difficult path ahead for negotiations  
MUFG  Chris Rupkey
 For weeks now markets have been lulled to sleep on the U S  trade war with China thinking an agreement was imminent  No more   Rupkey wrote in a note 
 This has all the makings of a complete disaster that could lead the stock market to crater this week   he said  It may also jack up  external risks to the U S  economic outlook   just a few days after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said global risks had moderated somewhat 
Compass Point  Isaac Boltansky
Trump s threat to hike tariffs is  a standard part of his negotiating style and we remain bullish on the prospects for a deal in the coming weeks   Boltansky wrote in a note  Though there  will be puts and takes in this story   believes  pressure on both sides of the Pacific will ultimately catalyze a deal  
 Beijing is sending roughly 100 representatives to Washington this week  which we view as indicative of their belief that a deal is within striking distance   At the same time  he warned that  once attention turns from China to other trade matters   including the USMCA   market sentiment regarding trade policy could turn more cautious  
Cowen  Chris Krueger
The  return of Tariff Man  is  pretty shocking and surprising   even grading off the Trump Curve   Krueger wrote in a note 
Krueger offered several interpretations  The  cautious  one suggests  this is simply an intemperate tweet  s  by a president that can t help himself during a rainy Sunday afternoon   Trump really  really wants to see this deal finished by Friday and  perhaps mistakenly  believes this gives the U S  leverage  
The  not so cautious  interpretation is that  this is not an outer borough real estate transaction  Trump issued a Presidential Statement last week highlighting his gift as the world s premier hostage negotiator  tariffs are a very dangerous hostage and we believe will be seen as both provocative and insulting by Beijing   ",2019-05-06,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-street-wonders-whether-trumps-tariff-is-a-tactic-or-not-1857316,1857316

stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  JPMorgan   NYSE JPM    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Duke Energy   NYSE DUK    General Motors   NYSE GM   and Norfolk Southern   NYSE NSC   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog Top Analyst Reports for JPMorgan  Wells Fargo and Duke EnergyThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including JPMorgan  Wells Fargo and Duke Energy  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see JPMorgan s shares have gained  8 2  in the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry s increase of  3 4   The bank has an impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters The Zacks analyst thinks higher rates  improving loan balance  strong balance sheet  indicated by stress test clearance   opening branches in new markets and focus on strengthening credit card business will support the bank s financials  Expanding its reach into lucrative U S  healthcare payments market with a deal to acquire InstaMed will aid profitability However  dismal mortgage banking performance  mainly due to lower origination volume and increase in competition  is expected to continue hampering fee income growth  The company s significant dependence on capital markets revenues makes us wary and is expected to hurt revenue growth to some extent  You can   Shares of Wells Fargo have underperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry in the past six months    1 4  vs   11 4    Its earnings surprise history is satisfactory  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters The Zacks analyst thinks Wells Fargo s restructuring activities and higher interest income  aided by loan growth  remain a tailwind  Further  ongoing investment in the businesses to enhance compliance and risk management capability bodes well  Recently  the company also cleared the Fed s 2019 stress test However  Wells Fargo has been slapped with several sanctions  including a cap on its asset growth by the Fed  This is an outcome of the CFPB s dissatisfaction with the bank s slow progress on fixing risk management issues  Rising expenses due to pending litigation issues and hike in personnel costs curb bottom line expansion  You can   Duke Energy s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry in the past year  gaining  13 3  vs  12 4   The Zacks analyst likes Duke Energy s strong focus on expanding its scale of operations and implementing modern technologies at the company s facilities Heavy investments are made in infrastructure and expansion projects  The company expects to invest about  37 billion in its overall growth projects during the 2019 2023 period  This investment plan will drive earnings base growth in the company s combined electric and gas businesses by approximately 6   over the next five years However  massive debt levels can turn out to be a major headwind for the company  Currently  Duke Energy s strategy includes generation of cleaner energy  due to which it is anticipated to incur environmental compliance cost of  2 78 billion for the 2019 2023 period  Such costs may dampen its bottom line growth  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are

348332,GOOGL,Net neutrality rules could return at state level under mixed U S  court decision,news,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON  Reuters    Internet providers could face a variety of state internet regulations after a U S  court ruled on Tuesday that the federal government cannot block states from passing their own net neutrality laws  while largely upholding the 2017 repeal of landmark rules barring providers from blocking or throttling traffic   The U S  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the Federal Communications Commission erred when it declared that states cannot pass their own net neutrality laws and ordered the agency to review some key aspects of its 2017 repeal of rules set by the Obama administration  But it left open the possibility the FCC could seek to block state efforts on a case by case basis  The decision could subject internet providers to a variety of state regulations on internet traffic   Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ  said the ruling  underscores the need for Congress to adopt national legislation that provides protections for consumers while avoiding a disruptive  inconsistent patchwork of state Internet regulation   The court also found that the FCC acted properly when it overturned a 2015 decision that had classified broadband internet as a utility style service that handed the FCC sweeping authority to regulate it and instead classified it as less regulated information service  But the court also found the agency  failed to examine the implications of its decisions for public safety  and must also review how its decision will impact a government subsidy program for low income users  The decision means the more than 10 year old debate over net neutrality will continue to drag on for months or more likely years as Congress has refused to pass legislation that would end the debate  The 2017 FCC decision handed internet providers sweeping powers to recast how Americans use the internet  as long as they disclose changes  The new rules took effect in June 2018  reversing rules adopted under former President Barack Obama in 2015 which barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic  or offering paid fast lanes  also known as paid prioritization  FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the decision affirmed the FCC s  decision to repeal 1930s utility style regulation of the internet  A free and open internet is what we have today  A free and open internet is what we ll continue to have going forward   Pai added that the FCC would address  the narrow issues that the court identified   John Bergmayer  legal director at Public Knowledge  said the decision  leaves states with a clear path forward to enact state net neutrality laws to protect internet users and provide certainty for participants in the digital economy  States should move expeditiously to protect consumers where the FCC has refused to do so   A senior FCC official told reporters on a conference call that the decision is  not a green light  for states to pass any internet rules they want and said the FCC has not decided whether to appeal portions of the decision  Championed by large tech companies and consumer groups  net neutrality was formally adopted by the FCC in 2015  Major telecommunications companies argued it limited their ability to offer new services to content providers  and under the Trump administration  the FCC overturned the policy  California adopted sweeping state net neutrality protections in October 2018 but agreed not to enforce the measure pending the court challenge  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  a California Democrat  said the decision was a  disappointing blow to the promise of a free and open internet  but she said  California s leadership in enacting the strongest net neutrality protections in the country is a model that will ensure that the internet remains an engine of innovation  job creation and free speech for all Americans   California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the decision  blocks the FCC s effort to preempt state net neutrality laws through regulation   The court threw out the part of the order that barred all states from setting net neutrality rules   The commission lacked the legal authority to categorically abolish all 50 states statutorily conferred authority to regulate intrastate communications   the court said  The FCC could still make  provision specific arguments  to seek to block individual aspects of state net neutrality rules   Judge Stephen Williams  NYSE WMB  wrote in his dissenting opinion that  On my colleagues  view  state policy trumps federal  or  more precisely  the most draconian state policy trumps all else   The Internet Innovation Alliance  a group representing companies including AT T Inc  NYSE T   said the decision  allowing rules that differ among all 50 states could spell disaster for advancement of the internet

265968,XOM,3 Stocks Primed To Deliver High Returns As Fed Cuts Rates,opinion,"The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rate with the policy statement this afternoon  If the Fed delivers  it would be the second rate cut this year  The first reduction in borrowing costs to be issued since 2008 came at the July policy meeting  where the U S  central bank announced a 25 basis point cut  which brought the current range between 2 00  to 2 25   

As the Fed eases borrowing costs  these three stocks have potential to deliver strong returns in the months ahead 
KB Home  Benefiting From Rate Cut Tailwinds  
KB Home  NYSE KBH   one of the nation s largest homebuilders  has made a solid recovery from the selloff the stock suffered in late 2018  with shares rising nearly 64  so far this year  It closed at  31 24 on Tuesday  after touching a fresh 52 week high of  31 36 earlier in the session  giving it a market cap of  3 0 billion  
The strong year to date  YTD  performance has been driven by robust demand for its single family homes  primarily from first time buyers  

With interest rates and mortgage rates falling to their lowest levels in years  it makes sense for this homebuilder to be on an investors radar  The yield on the 10 year Treasury note a benchmark for mortgage rates recently fell to its lowest level in three years  making it easier for first time buyers to finance a home purchase  The drop in rates should result in a boost in new home sales  especially in the entry level market  
The Los Angeles based homebuilder next reports earnings after the U S  market closes on Sep  25  Consensus calls for earnings per share  EPS  of  0 66 for the third quarter  up from EPS of  0 51 in the preceding quarter  Revenue is forecast to rise 15  from the second quarter  to  1 17 billion 
Procter   Gamble  Consumer Stock Fit For More Gains
Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  is one of the largest consumer goods corporations in the world  The stock is up around 32  in 2019 thanks in large part to its improved underlying sales outlook  During its recently concluded fiscal fourth quarter  the company s organic sales grew 7  the most in a decade 
Shares of the Cincinnati based giant ended at  121 16 last night  not far from their recent record high of  123 43 reached on September 5  giving it a market cap of  303 2 billion 

It s no surprise that this leading name made the cut  as lower borrowing costs tend to spur spending  Americans are likely to have extra disposable income if the cost of their mortgage debt is lower  freeing up more cash to spend on consumable items 
Procter   Gamble s hefty dividend payout and attractive yield make it an even likelier candidate to outperform in the months ahead as the Fed cuts rates  The company raised its quarterly dividend by 4  in April to  0 74 per share  This represents an annualized dividend of  2 96 and a yield of 2 44  
The consumer behemoth is set to publish earnings for its fiscal first quarter before the markets open on Oct  29  Consensus calls for EPS of  1 23  which would indicate a year over year  YoY  EPS growth rate of 10   Revenue is expected to rise roughly 5  from the same period a year earlier to  17 5 billion 
Exxon Mobil  Global Oil Giant  Attractive Dividend Yield
 Exxon Mobil   NYSE XOM  doesn t need an introduction  Shares of the world s largest publicly traded oil and gas corporation are up almost 8  this year  The stock closed at  73 17 last night with a market cap of  309 5 billion 

High dividend stocks tend to perform well in a low rate environment as the hunt for yield intensifies  The energy provider announced a quarterly dividend of  0 87 per share in April  which implies an annualized dividend of  3 43 per share  Exxon Mobil stock s dividend yield is currently 4 79   making it an extremely attractive play in the current environment of declining rates 
In addition  lower rates usually lead to a weaker dollar  which in turn boosts the value of dollar denominated oil futures contracts  as this makes oil cheaper for buyers in other currencies  This tends to help stocks of commodity producers 
The Irving  Texas based company is scheduled to release third quarter earnings on Nov  1  before the open  Consensus calls for EPS of  0 90  up 47  from earnings of  0 61 per share in the second quarter  Revenue is forecast to come in at  62 9 billion ",2019-09-18,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-primed-to-deliver-high-returns-as-fed-cuts-rates-200465551,200465551

376993,AMZN,Australia s Property Stocks Are Ignoring the Housing Slump,news," Bloomberg     Australian property stocks are proving largely immune to the worst housing slump in a generation  rallying to the highest in almost three years 
Diversified revenue streams  the demand for offices in a growing economy and low bond yields have propelled the S P ASX 200 A REIT Index up 13 percent this year  compared with the nation s benchmark index  which has climbed 9 2 percent  Fifteen of the 18 stocks on the gauge are in the green  with Charter Hall Group and Goodman Group leading the rally 
The last time real estate shares were higher  Australia s housing prices were climbing after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut borrowing costs to record lows in 2016  fueling demand for property  Those rates have since remained untouched 
Australia s property slump deepened in February as housing prices fell 0 7 percent  and are now down 6 8 percent from their peak in October 2017  Stricter lending standards have dried up the flow of credit to both investors and owner occupiers 
The Top Three
The index s top stocks  Goodman and Charter Hall  don t meet the definition of traditional REITs because most of their income doesn t come from collecting rent  said Pete Morrissey  a fund manager APN Property Group Ltd  For warehouse giant Goodman  a large portion of its revenue comes from development and funds management earnings 
The shift to online shopping has also been a boon to industrial property groups like Goodman  said Belinda Ngo  executive director for capital markets at the Property Council of Australia  Goodman  which lists Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   as its biggest customer worldwide  is up 25 percent this year 
Mirvac Group    the third best performer on the index    derives more than half its revenue from residential assets  but has invested in high quality apartments and built up its office and retail portfolios  The stock has jumped 21 percent this year 
 Residential sentiment weighed on them a lot in the past   Morrissey said of Mirvac   Finally  the market has seen through that  
The office property market has also skyrocketed  Companies with solid office portfolios have benefited from a strong Australian economy that s fueled demand for workspaces  Ngo said  Dexus  the nation s biggest office landlord  is up 19 percent since December 
Still  not all companies on the index have been unscathed by the downturn  Stockland  a diversified real estate group that develops residential and retirement communities  set its earnings guidance at the low end of its target range this year  citing weak housing conditions 
Value Trap
Some are still cautious after the big rally  Macquarie Securities  Australia  Ltd  downgraded its sector recommendation to a hold from buy earlier this month  citing rising risks in the retail space 
 We see this as a value trap  analysts led by Rob Freeman said in the report dated March 8   This is because half the sector is retail malls and we believe the outlook has never been worse than it is today  
Retail REITs such as Scentre Group  which owns and manages the nation s Westfield malls  and Vicinity Centres were among the worst performers on the index over the February reporting season 
Although retail dominates Australia s REIT market  the index s other members are pulling the sector higher given growing demand in other parts of commercial real estate  Morrissey said 
Bond Yields
The negative correlation between government bond yields and REITs is another reason for the surge  Australia s 10 year bond yield has continued its decline this year  the lowest since 2016  and yield hungry investors may be taking cover in REITs 
The volatility seen in equities markets late last year could have also helped Australia s REITs  The stocks could have been seen as a safe bet for investors as they usually perform better as the market gets bumpy  Morrissey said ",2019-03-21,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/australias-property-stocks-are-ignoring-the-housing-slump-1814672,1814672

and future data and expectations   A quick glance at the graph itself and the orange earnings justified valuation line will tell the readers volumes about how well the company has historically been

results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 22 9  Annualized ROR  w o Div   green circle   long term shareholders of Qualcomm Inc  assuming an initial investment of  10 000  would have received an additional  17 771 69 in total dividends paid  blue highlighting  that increased their Annualized ROR  w o Div  from 22 9  to a Total Annualized ROR plus Dividends Paid of 23 7  versus 3 1  in the S P

as low as it has been since 1999 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current P S ratio relative to its historical P S ratio  The current P S ratio for Qualcomm Inc is 5 06 which is historically low  Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants

other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Qualcomm Inc to an equal

321345,TGT,UPDATE 2 India upholds 2009 10 debt plan  overshoot risk seen,news,"  Full yr target of 4 51 trillion rupees remain unchanged
   Excludes conversion of mkt intervention bonds   secy
   Analysts warn farm subsidies may boost spending 
borrowing
  Recasts with finance secretary s comment 
 By Manoj Kumar and Rajesh Kumar Singh
 NEW DELHI  Sept 29  Reuters    India will stick to its
borrowing target for 2009 10  finance ministry officials said
on Tuesday  but analysts warned drought relief spending may
strain government finances and force it to sell more bonds 
 Finance Secretary Ashok Chawla said the government would
borrow a gross 1 23 trillion rupees   25 6 billion  in the
second half of the year  That together with a conversion of
market intervention bonds into regular debt  would keep total
borrowing for the full year at 4 51 trillion rupees  the target
set by the government at the start of the year 
  There is no intention to increase that number at all   he
said 
 Analysts said markets had expected the government to
confirm the borrowing goal  but the worst dry spell in nearly
four decades could increase the food subsidy bill in the second
half of the year  possibly forcing the government to borrow
more 
  The borrowing target will most likely be overshot  The
budgeted revenue forecasts are very optimistic  that is the
primary reason for this expectation   said Ramya
Suryanarayanan  economist at DBS in Singapore 
  There could also be some expenditure related to the
monsoon deficit  and in case the borrowing is indeed increased 
it would lead to a rise in bond yields   she said 
 The 10 year benchmark bond yield  was at 7 13
percent by 0830 GMT  compared with 7 17 percent at the previous
close 
 The government has sold 2 95 trillion rupees of bonds in
April September 
 A formal meeting between central bank and finance ministry
officials was scheduled for 3 p m   0930 GMT  to finalise the
borrowing calendar for October March 
 Analysts said higher tax receipts  reflecting improving
economic activity  and possible extra revenue from G3 mobile
auction could still help keep the fiscal deficit within bounds 
though uncertainty over farm sector performance was set to
haunt the bond market 
  1 23 trillion rupees is perfectly in line with what
markets had expected  but there is an upside risk to that 
given that monsoon has created a lot of uncertainties   said
Rupa Rege Nitsure  chief economist at Bank of Baroda 
 Concerns over extra supply coincide with a recent pick up
in inflation  fuelling speculation that the central bank will
be one of the first major monetary authorities to start
withdrawing its policy stimulus  starting with a tightening of
liquidity and reserve requirements for banks 
 The benchmark 10 year yield has risen 188 basis points so
far this year  reflecting both building expectations of a
policy reversal and concerns over debt supply 
 As the global downturn hit the country harder than expected
last year  the Reserve Bank of India slashed reserve
requirements  flooded markets with liquidity and cut its main
lending rate by 425 basis points between October and April 
 Spreads between the 1 year and 5 year swaps narrowed
between end of May and mid Sept  as the market factored in a
rate hike early next year along with anticipated tightness in
cash conditions  pushing up the one year tenor swaps 
 However  spreads are now widening following comments from
RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao earlier this month that the
central bank would not unwind its accommodative monetary policy
before ensuring recovery   ID nBOM530668

279834,AAPL,S P 500  Challenging Recent High,opinion,"Current Position of the Market
S P 500  Long term trend   The bull market is continuing with a top expected in the low 3000s 
Intermediate trend   A new correction has started  More time is needed to determine its extent and duration 
Analysis of the short term trend is done on a daily basis with the help of hourly charts  It is an important adjunct to the analysis of daily and weekly charts which discusses the course of longer market trends  
Market Overview 
Last week  S P 500 filled the count established at the 2860 level by dropping to 2802  formed a small base  and rallied strongly on the news that there appeared to be a d tente in the potential trade war between the US and China  Should these prove to be false expectations  the market will most likely react by reversing its short term direction once again  From a purely technical basis  the count provided by the small accumulation base after the 2802 low has been filled to the extreme  and it is logical to expect a pull back before re testing the 2860 high  We need to see how much of a pull back we get  and observe the market action afterwards to determine if we are indeed ready to surpass the current high  or if a deeper and larger retracement will be needed before doing so  Next week should help to clarify the market s current position 
It might be noteworthy to point out that for the second short term correction in a row  S P 500 failed to retrace  382 of its previous rally  Is this the sign of a strong market  of one which is overbought and needs more correcting  Last week  I pointed out that DJIA was a laggard compared to other principal indexes but it just gave a strong performance  Since AAPL has become part of the DOW the latter has become more volatile  and AAPL was exceptionally strong in this rally    and so was the DOW  NDX was a laggard  but IWM will be the one to watch  It has been consolidating since the beginning of July and has established a large congestion pattern  If it breaks out on the upside  it should lead the market higher  On the other hand  a decline from here could lead to an extended correction 
Chart analysis  The charts that are shown below are courtesy of QCharts 
S P 500 daily chart
For the time being  S P 500 is ranging between the former high and the 2800 level  establishing strong support which would signal a larger and deeper correction if broken  But currently  our focus should be more on whether or not this index is on its way to making a new high  Two weeks ago  it came within less than 10 points of doing so  This week  it is trying again but has exhausted its current short term potential to the upside  It will therefore require some retracement to eliminate the near term overbought condition and create another launching platform for its next try  Next week should therefore be a period of preparation for another assault 
Since we should have another pull back over the next few days  the daily indicators could easily turn negative again  But instead of putting all of our attention on this index  let s keep an eye on IWM which has led the market in both directions lately and should continue to do so  It closed the week at 168 35 and a move past 170 would have bullish implications for the rest of the market  We ll also have to keep another eye     on NDX and DJIA  since both of these have a direct influence on S P 500  I just took a look at Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  which seems to be very overbought with negative divergence in its daily indicators    a warning that it may be ready for a pull back and take DJIA with it 

S P 500 hourly chart
As you can see  at the last low  2802  S P 500 did not have the time to create a very large base before the next news driven rally started  It is likely that traders had advance notice and reacted immediately  Still  when translated to a P F chart  there was enough of a count in that base to take it as high as it went on Friday  Meaning that we should start a correction right away or after a throw over of a couple more points  It would be very unorthodox for the index to draw additional count from the pattern that formed just above the 2820 level so that it could push higher before correcting  but if there is more bullish news over the week end  this is what could happen 
The oscillator pattern strongly suggests that what we already have is all we get for now  Double divergence has formed on the top oscillator  CCI  and this  under normal circumstances  suggests that a correction is about to start  After it gets under way  we can try to establish a projection for the extent of the retracement 

S P 500  Nasdaq 100  iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  daily 
We are looking at the charts that we analyzed earlier  S P 500 was the strongest performer last week  but should now correct  IWM had a pull back equivalent to that of S P 500  but did not rally as strongly  stopping a little short of its last top while S P 500 exceeded it  NDX s decline was curtailed when it found support on a trend line resulting in a more shallow retracement than the other two  This relative strength in NDX should have led to an immediate challenge of its former high  but instead  it had the weakest rally of the three  That probably makes it more vunerable in the coming reversal since it is not ikely to hold again above the trend line  In any case  it had already established enough distribution to correct down to 7210  If it breaks its trend line  it could come down to that level in the next correction  If DJIA also corrects sharply along with a correction in AAPL  this will be a double whammy for S P 500  So  the week ahead could be interesting 

PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish  NYSE UUP   dollar ETF  daily
After surging to its P F target of 25 50    a few pennies   UUP is now starting to correct  Until it shows some real weakness it may still go a little higher  and it would have to decline below its trend line to begin a move down to the 24 80 support 

GDX  NYSE GDX   Gold miners ETF 
GDX has dropped to the bottom of a broad declining channel where it is beginning to find support  It is probably not a coincidence that this weakness corresponds to the time frame when the 65 wk cycle was due to make its low  Nor need this be the final low since there is the potential for a point or so lower  Friday marked the first up day after a drop of about 20  without a single rally or even consolidation  Surely  the index is entitled to an oversold bounce  Even a minimum Fib retracement of  235 would bring it back to about 19 50  Eventually  a retracement of 50  would return it to the level of the broken support which is now resistance 

USO  United States Oil Fund  NYSE USO  
USO has started its correction after reaching its 15  target  and dropped to 13 50 last week before bouncing  It will probably have to get down to about 13 00 before it starts to consolidate in anticipation of continuing its longer term uptrend 

Summary

302076,MSFT,In A Rising Rate Environment  Does Dividend Growth Still Make Sense ,opinion,This is the question on every income investor s mind  After a five month start to the year in which income focused investments went nearly parabolic  concerns that the Fed might just might start winding down its quantitative easing sent the share prices of REITs  MLPs  utilities  and other popular investments into a tailspin  The JP Morgan Alerian MLP ETN  AMJ  and the Vanguard REIT ETF  VNQ  both holdings in the  dropped by 6  and 10   respectively  from their May 21 highs through June 4  at time of writing  Some of Sizemore Capital s favorite income securities held in the  such as Realty Income  O   National Retail Properties  NNN   and Martin Midstream  MMLP  were down by 20   17   and 10   respectively  After dramatic reversals like these  it s easy to panic  But let s put them in perspective  Even after the May bloodletting  all of these securities are positive for the year  and after including dividends all are up by over 10   The price correction we saw was simply a shakeout  The hot money had run the prices of these securities up  and when the hot money abandoned them they simply wiped away the speculative froth  Interestingly  REITs and utilities took a harder hit than MLPs  Though I have no hard evidence to support this  my theory as to why this happened was that MLPs tend to have greater ownership by individual income investors and tend to be less affected by the hot money s changing moods  So  back to the original question  what now  In an environment of rising rates  does a dividend growth strategy still make sense  It does  but only if you do it right  Sizemore Capital has very little exposure to bonds and no exposure at all to slow growth income investments such as utilities  In this environment and in any environment of non zero inflation future dividend growth is more important than the current payout  This is why we are overweight in the sectors with what we consider the right mix of decent current income and excellent potential growth in income sectors such as retail REITs  mid stream MLPs  and  Big Tech  companies such as Microsoft  MSFT   Intel  INTC   and Cisco Systems  CSCO   And to be clear  I am by no means certain that the rise in interest rates will go much higher than it already has in the near term  As the experience of Japan proved  market yields can stay low for much longer than anyone expects during a prolonged period of debt deflation and aging demographics  But to the extent that rates do rise  you want to own assets that stand to benefit from an improving economy and that have room to raise their cash payouts at a rate that will keep pace with rising market yields  On this count  midstream pipeline MLPs and most categories of REITs easily qualify  Rising interest rates raise their borrowing costs and cut growth prospects at the margin  And because these securities have become bond substitutes of late  falling bond prices  i e  rising yields  mean falling stock prices  But given that the 10 year Treasury still only yields 2 1   a 4   dividend yield an a high quality real estate and infrastructure portfolio still makes them vastly superior investments for income investors  The dividend payout can be expected to grow over time with only modest risk of loss  whereas Treasuries are only  risk free  if you ignore inflation  We may see more turbulence in dividend focused investments as institutional investors rotate into more aggressive sectors  I m ok with that  and I intend to use any further weakness as a buying opportunity  Disclosures  All securities mentioned are held in Sizemore Capital portfolios ,2013-06-08,Charles Sizemore,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/in-a-rising-rate-environment,-does-dividend-growth-still-make-sense-170295",170295
262005,DIS,Movie Studios Considering Rental Plan With Apple   Comcast,opinion,"Against the wishes of movie theaters  movie studios are considering a plan to offer digital rentals of new movies to Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   and Comcast   NASDAQ CMCSA   just weeks after they premiere in theaters 
According to   some of the biggest studios include Warner Bros   owned by Time Warner   NYSE TWX    and Universal Pictures  which is owned by Comcast  The Walt Disney Company   NYSE DIS   is one of the only leading movie studios not interested in such a deal because of its plan to release its own streaming service in 2019 
Terms of the deals vary between studios as each are negotiating separately  One potential deal could see a digital release date of about 17 days after debut for  50  while another deal could involve a release date of four to six weeks after debut for  30 
Movie studios are eager for a deal with Apple and Comcast to offset declining DVD sales  In the first half of 2017  DVD sales were down 10   to the industry backed researcher DEG 
The studios have also discussed splitting revenue made from premium video on demand with cinema chains if they agree to the deal  However  theater companies have asked for a long term commitment as long as 10 years for a revenue split  which the studios have rejected 
As a result  if movie theaters do not agree to terms that the studios like  the movie studios could progress without giving theaters anything 
Further Trouble for Movie Theater Chain Stocks
This news has caused movie theater stocks to fall in midday trading on Friday  Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc    NYSE AMC   and Regal Entertainment Group   NYSE RGC   have fallen 5   while Cinemark Holdings   NYSE CNK   stock is down 2  
However  this is far from the only news hurting movie theaters this month  Early in August  AMC released poor second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings  reporting an earnings loss of  1 33 per share  Since then  AMC has fallen from  20 80 per share to  13 10 as of yesterday s close 
These poor results are a part of an industry trend  AMC reported that U S  box office revenue dropped 4 4  year over year  Additionally  the Motion Picture Association of America has reported that frequent moviegoers dropped by almost 2 million from 2012 to 2016  also read    
Additionally  MoviePass  a movie ticket subscription service  announced this week that it will lower its monthly fee to  9 95 a month  This would allow subscribers to see unlimited movies for about the same cost as a Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX   subscription 
In reaction  AMC is seeking to legally block MoviePass from offering its service to AMC s 600 theaters because the program s pricing is  unsustainable   AMC said MoviePass could not pay theaters full ticket price with the discount if subscribers see more than one movie a month because the company has  not yet known how to turn lead into gold  
However  MoviePass maintains that its recent sale of a majority stake to Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc    NASDAQ HMNY   allows it to lower its subscription fees   There must be some way to make us whole   said MoviePass CEO Mitch Lowe  a co founder of Netflix   We can work together with them in a constructive manner so that everybody makes more money  
Whether AMC can win this fight is yet to be seen  Either way  AMC and other cinema chains will need to grapple with lower turnout while streaming services continue to expand  The potential deals between movie studios and Apple and Comcast could close as early as next year

231772,NDAQ,Exclusive  U S  options exchanges craft rules to fend off turmoil,news,"By John McCrank NEW YORK  Reuters    A year after Goldman Sachs  N GS  bungled a software upgrade and lost tens of millions of dollars from unintended trades  the 12 U S  stock options exchanges have crafted new rules for dealing with erroneous transactions  according to draft documents seen by Reuters 
Under the proposed rules  unintended trades placed by professional traders will usually have their prices adjusted to levels as close to their fair market value as possible  while wrong trades by retail customers will be mainly be undone  five sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters 
The rules are meant to protect investors from algorithms gone wild and other sources of market turmoil  Regulators and exchange operators across equities  commodities and other markets have been taking steps to prevent mistaken trades from spiraling into collapses  a rising concern as trading grows increasingly automated 
When market prices are oscillating wildly  technical glitches can create turmoil  said Andy Nybo  head of derivatives research at advisory firm TABB Group 
 A cohesive solution for the industry is critical to get in place before we have another technology blowup   he said 
In other markets  technical glitches have created big trouble for traders  Knight Capital Group  a stock trading firm now known as KCG Holdings Inc  lost  461 1 million in August 2012 from new software that was improperly installed  The loss forced the company to seek  400 million of rescue capital and eventually led to its sale to a rival firm 
But critics say the new stock option trading rules are hardly perfect  Participants often don t know whether they are trading with a professional or a retail investor  If markets start surging or plunging unexpectedly  traders have no way of knowing if their positions will disappear  or be adjusted 
That uncertainty could result in many traders exiting a choppy market just when they are most needed  said Thomas Peterffy  founder and head of Interactive Brokers  O IBKR   a brokerage and options market maker 
 All of the liquidity goes out of the marketplace and then it will never recover   he said  Although listed stock options markets are a fraction of the size of U S  equities market  derivatives exchanges are seen as a crucial tool for dealers and other market participants to offload risk from the stock market 
The proposed rules come at the behest of U S  Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary Jo White  who last September ordered the heads of the exchanges to take specific steps to make the cash equities and options markets more sound  including a unified rule for obvious errors for options trades 
Exchanges have been fine tuning the plan with the help of the SEC since June  and expect to file it with the regulator in four to six weeks  according to one of the people  All of the sources asked to remain anonymous because the details are not yet public 
Once the plan is filed with the SEC  it will be made available for public comment  which will later be reviewed by the regulator before deciding on whether to approve the rule 
Options exchange operators NYSE  which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc  N ICE   Nasdaq OMX Group  O NDAQ   BATS Global Markets  CBOE Holdings  O CBOE   International Securities Exchange  owned by Deutsche Boerse  DE DB1Gn   and BOX Options Exchange  owned by TMX Group  TO X   declined to comment for this story  as did the SEC  Miami International Holdings Inc did not respond to a request for comment 
 
ONE PROBLEM  A DOZEN SETS OF RULES
Options trade across a dozen different exchanges  and each exchange has its own rules for how to deal with mistaken trades 
Those differing rules can create trouble  In August 2013  Goldman s software snafu resulted in its flooding stock options markets with bad trades  pushing the prices of some options down sharply 
When Goldman Sachs said the transactions were erroneous  some exchanges canceled the positions  and some did not  Traders that had bought an option from Goldman on one exchange and sold the same position on another could have found themselves holding an option they thought they had sold  Goldman s losses would have been far greater had most of the trades not been canceled 
In crafting rules for dealing with mistaken trades  exchanges had originally planned to adjust most obviously erroneous trades  said three people familiar with the matter  But retail brokers objected  and said that their customers tend to make mistakes that professionals don t  such as buying or selling a completely different option from what they had intended to trade 
Allowing different treatment for professional traders versus retail investors seemed like a middle ground  the sources said  Retail trading accounted for 24 3 percent of options market volume in the first half  according to TABB Group 
Under the rules  a trade is deemed obviously erroneous if its price differs dramatically from the market level for that option soon before and after the transaction was executed  But the rules also allow market participants to change trades that were harmed by unexpected market movements that had nothing to do with technical glitches  a trade can be deemed obviously mistaken even if the price movement that triggered the trade was just a market gyration after a surprising event 
After the proposed rules are in place  the exchanges will then consider a second phase of coordination  including appointing a single  uniform source for determining the theoretical prices of options  something that each of the exchanges now does on its own  three of the sources said  The exchanges will also look at implementing a system similar to one in the stock markets where options would be prevented from trading outside a range based on recent prices  the people said 

The exchanges have given themselves leeway in the rules that would allow them to cancel all erroneous trades for all participants if they think that doing so would lead to getting the market back to a normal state as quickly as possible

295421,TSLA,Theresa May And Brexit,opinion,"British Prime Minister Theresa May is apparently marching forward with plans for Brexit  The politico who rose to prominence not as a Boris Johnson esque  Brexiteer  but as the David Cameron supporter who first publicly came to grips with the UK vote to divorce itself from the European Union when she said  Brexit means Brexit   soon thereafter won the election and now means to honor the vote many Brits feel was a mistake after the fact 

Great Britain still needs to execute Article 50  the measure that would effectively shift Britain s laws from the EU back to the UK  and this is expected to happen sometime in late March 2017  This move  marks the first stage in the UK becoming a  sovereign  and  independent  country once again   May said   It s all getting very real now  folks  

There had been open speculation since the Brexit vote in late June that perhaps Article 50 would not be issued  after all  that somehow the powers in Great Britain would hash out a new deal with the EU that would modify the popular vote decision  But it looks as though May is staying true to her word   Brexit is  still  Brexit   it would appear

281343,AAPL,3  High Yield Leaders  To Buy For 5  To 12  Payouts,opinion,"It s been a rough year thus far for many high paying investments  From utilities to REITs  real estate investment trusts  to high yield bonds  many are getting crushed as rates rise 
Why High Yield Shortcuts are for Losers
But we don t dumbly buy these indices  We cherry pick the very best of the high yield lot  After all  there is always a bull market somewhere  or in something   And this is where we should invest for big dividends and price upside to boot 
The Strongest Names in High Yield  Year To Date 
So let s discuss these  dividend market leaders  and see why they are acting strong while their cousins make interest rate excuses  All pay 5  to 12  dividends and have additional price upside to boot 
 Remember  when high yield markets turn around  we should first consider the stocks that were acting the strongest when times were tough  Here are three  
GlaxoSmithKline PLC ADR  NYSE GSK Dividend Yield  5 4 YTD Gains  13 
GlaxoSmithKline  GSK  is a U K  based pharmaceutical stock that has earned a place among healthcare s blue chip elite  This is the company behind asthma treatment Advair   one of the top dozen or so best selling pharmaceutical products of all time   as well as Paxil  Valtrex  Avandia and Zantac 
The company s success in 2018 has largely come on the back of its fourth quarter earnings results  released in early February  GSK put up a 72 cent per share profit to beat estimates by 3 cents  and revenues grew 4  to  10 3 billion  topping expectations of  9 9 billion  The biggest fireworks came from its New Pharmaceutical and Vaccine products division  which jumped 51  thanks to success in HIV  respiratory and meningitis prevention drugs 
But GSK also has made a few moves that set it up for continued success for the rest of the year 
GlaxoSmithKline in March took full control over a consumer health joint venture with Novartis  NVS   buying out the latter s remaining 36 5  stake for  13 billion   a move that was met with optimism by shareholders in both companies  The joint venture includes products such as painkiller Panadol and sensitive tooth toothpaste Sensodyne 
And just days ago  GlaxoSmithKline hired Kevin Sin away from Roche Holding  SIX ROG  Ltd ADR  OTC RHHBY  Genentech unit  Sin has been a part of more than 100 healthcare deals during his career  says Reuters  and is expected to lead Glaxo on its own hunt for new products  That  combined with increased spending on R D   the company s  4 5 billion spend was its most dedicated effort in a decade   should do wonders for its pipeline 
One final note  GSK often gets flack for its seemingly untenable payout ratio  As a percentage of earnings  180  is certainly worrisome   but understand that as a percentage of cash  which actually pays the dividends   it s just under 85   That doesn t leave a ton of room for hikes  but it does put the dividend s safety in a much kinder light 
Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income II Closed Fund  NYSE EOS Distribution Rate  6 4 YTD Gains  8 
The Eaton Vance Enhanced Income Fund II  EOS  was built for markets like this 
In a nutshell  EOS invests in large  and mid cap stocks with an eye toward growth and financial stability  While that bent typically would result in a sub 2  yield for a bland index exchange traded fund  this  also writes calls to generate additional income   a strategy that can excel in a flat market 
Right now  it s putting other growth ETFs to shame 
Eaton Vance s EOS Is Head and Shoulders Above the Competition
The management team of Michael Allison  Lewis Piantedosi and Yana Barton invest in  and trade options against  roughly 60 stocks  including current top holdings Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   Trading against individual stocks rather than a full index  again  like several passive options trading ETFs  allows EOS to be more tactical  grabbing premium when it s there and avoiding selling covered calls when it might be detrimental to performance 
EOS actually sports long term outperformance against the S P 500  gaining about 9 4  annually to the index s 9 23   But this CEF has really added some distance over the past year  racing off to 29  gains against the market s 18  
In other words  this is far from just a yield play   EOS packs a growth punch  too 
New Senior Investment Group  NYSE SNR Dividend Yield  12 1 YTD Gains  12 
New Senior Investment Group  SNR  is the quintessential Baby Boomer play  And make no mistake    which will send 10 000 of its members into retirement age every day through 2032 
This senior housing specialist owns 133 properties in 37 states  broken down into 102 independent living facilities  30 assisted living memory care property and 1 continuing care retirement community property  This REIT also has a triple net lease element  53 of its properties  mostly IL facilities  are in this  Holy Grail  situation in which tenants are on the hook for real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance  This model is simpler and more stable  making for more predictable revenues and income 
Better still  SNR is the only such REIT that is completely private pay in nature  which means it doesn t need to worry about changes to government programs 
Why SNR has outperformed this year  however  is complicated 
The company jumped after its Q4 and full year earnings report in February  but not because of exceptional performance  In fact  adjusted funds from operations  AFFO  declined by 11  to 24 cents per share  and total same store cash net operating income  NOI  only improved 1  
What did it was this little excerpt from the same report     the Company s Board of Directors has been exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value   Typically  this is corporate speak for  looking for a buyer   and adds the potential for an additional M A pop in SNR s future 
It s clear that New Senior Investment is running into some operational headwinds despite the rosy narrative  The newfound possibility of a buyout may help prop up shares and even give it a final boost should management strike a deal   but be wary of the potential downside should SNR s  exploring  lead to nothing

426324,GOLD,Barrick says Argentina mine operations may resume within two weeks,news,"DENVER  Reuters    Barrick Gold Inc s  TO ABX  Veladero gold mine in Argentina  one of its five core mines  could resume operations in the next two weeks  Barrick President Kelvin Dushnisky said in an interview on Monday 
 I am hopeful that it could be up and going in that kind of two week window depending on how the reparation work goes   Dushnisky said 
Barrick said on Thursday that mine operations were temporarily suspended by the Argentine government after a  small quantity  of processing solution containing cyanide leaked outside a processing area 
The solution flowed over a berm  or raised bank  surrounding the leach pad where gold is processed  after a pipe was damaged on Sept  8 by a large block of ice that rolled down a valley slope 
As part of the repair work  Barrick  the world s biggest gold producer  will raise the height of the berm  Dushnisky said on the sidelines of the Denver Gold Forum 
The restart will be subject to the government of the San Juan province inspecting the work  The government has been  very responsive  in the past  Dushnisky said

237860,FCX,Chart Of The Day  Rio Tinto Rides Copper s Surge,opinion,"By Pinchas Cohen
Copper  sometimes called the red metal  is red hot right now  Its price has surged to the highest level for the metal in more than two years 
While the immediate beneficiaries are producers such as Australian British multinational metal miner Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO   copper   alongside the biggest oil upleg since November   is leading the rally in commodities and global indices 
An industrial metal used for manufacturing and construction  copper took off after the IMF raised its growth expectations for China for the remainder of this year and the next 
There some irony for the US economy in copper s recent gains  Once a hot commodity because of Trump s infrastructure plans  the metal fell as markets gave up on the US President s agenda becoming reality  But now  thanks to more aggressive growth expectations for China  it s on the move again 
Yesterday  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  reported during its earnings release that Chinese infrastructure equipment was responsible for a 10 percent boost in its second quarter revenue  leading shares to their highest level since March 2012 

Copper has been trading within a falling channel since February 2011  Since August of that year  it wasn t even able to approach the top of the channel  that is  until yesterday  Today  it crossed above the top  forming a daily shooting star  suggesting a decline 
Some form of price consolidation is due in any case  whether it remains within a downtrend  even though it reached the resistance of its downtrend line  or if investors believe it already bottomed and will continue to rise  since it gained 4 percent yesterday  reaching its highest level since May 2015 
The 78 28 daily RSI is the most oversold since November  though its 65 68 weekly RSI is far below the 72 5 weekly RSI of the same time  It s even below the previous  January 2 770 peak  This divergence may suggest a short term correction  even if it may cause a trend shift in the longer term 
Rio Tinto Gets A Boost Off Copper
Along with it being one of the top 10 global copper producers  Rio Tinto is making headlines  and not in a good way  The financial media is focusing on a corruption investigation over its Guinea operations  after company emails alluded to contractual payments to an unidentified consultant relating to its project in the Simandou mountains  which contain the world s largest untapped iron ore deposits 
The company says it conducted an internal investigation after it became aware of the emails in August  The executive involved has been fired and Rio Tinto has pledged to cooperate fully with the authorities 
That seemed to be good enough for investors  who yesterday boosted the stock by 5 2 percent  with a close that was 4 65 percent higher  Perhaps the rush on copper drowned out the negative news  or maybe savvy investors took advantage of Rio Tinto s industry leading fundamentals to acquire shares on this copper boom 
Of the top five copper producers  only Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  beat Rio  soaring 14 75 percent on the prospect of securing  with the Indonesian government for its local copper mine  The remaining three  top copper mining stocks advanced less  Anglo American  OTC NGLOY  rose only 1 2 percent  Southern Copper  NYSE SCCO  gained 3 15 percent and BHP Billiton  NYSE BHP  moved higher by 3 43 percent 
Another reason Freeport shares rose nearly three times those of Rio  is the fact that the good news on the stock follows a period of it being under owned  This is an odd assessment  considering that all five top copper stocks gained by percentages in the mid teens since the May bottom  Either way  Freeport s triple surge makes it the most over owned stock right now among its peers 
Rio s Fundamentals
Yearly EPS of 255 30
Return on Equity of 12 05   profits generated from shareholder capital
Return on Invested Capital of 6 45  dividing Net Income   Dividends by Total Capital Invested
Return on Assets of 5 28  measuring net income from total company assets  revealing how quickly a company can turn its assets into profits
Rio Tinto may also pay a  1 billion special dividend  to be announced when it reveals H1 profits in August  on lower capex  cost cutting and commodity prices rebounding 

The stock has been trading within a downward trend since February 2011  On July 14  the price crossed above this 6 5 year downtrend line for the first time  However  it fell back below it  Yesterday  it gapped up  crossing again over the downtrend line  and perhaps more importantly  overcoming the prices of the initial failed upside breakout  Notice that the initial breakout was on diminishing volume  while yesterday s breakout was on the highest volume since March 
While the price didn t enjoy the support of participation before  it does now  The 50 dma crossed over the 100 dma  which crossed over the 200 dma   a double  golden cross   which demonstrates the multi layered parameter of a rising trend  The last time this happened  in August  the price advanced over 40 percent  from  33 to  46  in the five months leading up to February 
On the other hand  the MACD provided a sell signal  when its slower moving average crossed below its faster moving average  and the RSI seemed to have completed an oversold top 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders would avoid a  bull trap  by waiting on a long position for the end of the advance and the correction to follow   which should be confirmed by diminishing volume   during which time the MACD and RSI should cool down 
Moderate traders may wait on a long position for a correction toward the intersection of the short term rising uptrend since June 20 and the violated long term downtrend line since February 2011  in the mid  44 area 
Aggressive traders would enter a long position now  with a stop loss beneath  44 
Very Aggressive traders may enter a short position now  against the trend  with a stop loss above yesterday s  46 18 high  hoping for a correction  before entering long when it turns back up ",2017-07-26,Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chart-of-the-day:-copper-and-rio-–-get-‘em-while-they’re-hot-200203526,200203526
344825,CME,EUR USD extends skid  as minutes signal further Fed ECB divergence,news,"Investing com    EUR USD fell mildly on Thursday as the minutes from meetings by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank last month provided further signals of continued divergence between two of the world s top central banks 
The currency pair traded between 1 1071 and 1 1150  before settling at 1 1104  down 0 15  on the session  At session s lows  the euro fell below 1 11 against the dollar for the first time in two weeks  With the slight losses  the euro posted its fifth straight loss versus its American counterpart and seventh over the last 10 sessions 
EUR USD likely gained support at 1 0538  the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1 1496  the high from Oct  15 
The euro hit session lows against the dollar on Thursday in European afternoon trading after the ECB released the minutes from a closely watched meeting last month  While the ECB s governing council opted to leave interest rates unchanged at the meeting  it sent strong indications that it could approve widespread measures in March aimed at spurring economic growth and boosting stubbornly low inflation  A closer view of the minutes could stoke expectations for further stimulus when the Governing Council convenes for its next monetary policy meeting on March 10 
 It needed to be reaffirmed that  if the Governing Council had to intensify the use of the available range of policy options in order to achieve its price stability mandate  it would not hesitate to do so   the ECB said in the minutes 
 Reassurance needed to be given that the Governing Council had a variety of instruments at its disposal to respond to circumstances and that there was no limit to how far it was willing to deploy instruments within its mandate to achieve the objective of inflation rates below  but close to  2  over the medium term  This would help to anchor inflation expectations and underline the significant differences in the monetary policy cycles between major advanced economies  
At the same time  the ECB is hoping to avoid the missteps that hampered its progress at a meeting in December when it failed to meet market expectations by approving only limited easing measures with its comprehensive asset purchasing program  As a result  the euro enjoyed its strongest one day performance against the dollar in more than a year and government bond prices tumbled 
Across the pond  investors also reacted to the release of January minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee over the previous session  The minutes from the Fed s first meeting since its historic rate decision in December  depict a divided committee torn on the timing of the pace of tightening needed to help fulfill its dual mandate  While several participants noted that further tightening delays could potentially lead to excessively high inflation  other members expressed concern that premature rate hikes could dampen progress in the economy and labor markets  the minutes showed  Long term inflation has remained below the FOMC s targeted goal of 2  for every month over the last three years 
In December  the FOMC abandoned a seven year zero interest rate policy by raising the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points to 0 25 and 0 50  
The CME Group s  O CME  Fed Watch tool increased the probability of one rate hike in 2016 to 33 9  on Thursday  up from an average of 15 1  a day earlier  The odds of a 25 basis point increase in March are still slim  Currently  there is a 4 1  chance of a Fed hike next month  according to the CME Group  down from nearly 30  a month earlier 
The U S  Dollar Index  which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies  rose by more than 0 15  to an intraday high of 97 09  before closing at 96 84  down 0 04  
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar  as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields ",2016-02-18,Investing.com,"https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/eur-usd-extends-skid,-as-minutes-signal-further-fed-ecb-divergence-385426",385426
426880,CTL,4 High Yield Landmines To Avoid At All Costs,opinion,"The stock market s up  so yields are down  And while there are still some generous payers available  be careful   some are paper tigers that will probably suffer this year 
That s exactly the danger that s facing four enticing high yielders  yielding up to 20    that I ll discuss with you shortly 
Since stock prices generally follow their payouts higher  it s important to remember the opposite also happens  When dividends get cut  shares get crushed 
I ve warned readers about Frontier Communications  NASDAQ FTR  and its dangerous dividend for years now  Hopefully investors listened to me  because those that didn t lost  two ways    they lost their yield and they lost their capital 
The Danger of Dividend Cuts
Frontier s 2017 dividend cut   as well as its 2018 dividend suspension   are just one cautionary tale  The telecom s debts from buying Verizon s  VZ  wireline business  as well as a shrinking customer base  eventually forced FTR s hand  Declines came  then a cut to the dividend  followed by even more declines   and eventually the payout was wiped out altogether 
The following four stocks yield anywhere between 7  and 20   and all of them are potentially toxic to retirement accounts in one way or another  whether it s plain vanilla underperformance  or a serious risk of an eventual dividend cut 
Global X SuperIncome Preferred ETF  SPFF  SEC Yield  7 3 
Preferred stocks are a great source of safe  stable yield that trade more like bonds than stocks  But they re far from a guarantee of riches  and some funds just flat out get them wrong 
Take the Global X SuperIncome Preferred ETF  SPFF   for instance 
At a quick glance  SPFF isn t all that different from other preferred funds  It holds a basket of preferred stocks  a majority of which come from financial institutions such as Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  and Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   DB   That s par for the preferred course  It s even better in one significant way  yield  SPFF s 7  plus output is among the best in the space 
But this is a small portfolio of just a few dozen preferred issues  and it s very top heavy  with nearly a quarter of the fund s assets dedicated to the top five holdings alone  Also  the fund is hyper focused on yield   so much so that it delves into not so stellar preferreds to do so  More than two thirds of the fund is invested in junk grade preferreds  and it has been even riskier in the past  The small number of holdings helps amplify the effect of poor performances from any one issue 
That has led to a history of underperformance against even some of the most mediocre competition in the space 
Global X s SuperIncome Preferred ETF  SPFF  Is Far From Super
CenturyLink  NYSE CTL Dividend Yield  11 3 
The aforementioned Frontier isn t the only telecom that has gotten taken to the woodshed in recent years  While big telcos like AT T  NYSE T  and Verizon  VZ  remain stable players  regional players such as CenturyLink  CTL  are having a difficult time 
CenturyLink is a Louisiana headquartered telecom that provides services such as home high speed internet  TV and phone  as well as business and government communications services  across 37 states  In fact  in terms of lines served  it s actually the No  3 telecom behind Verizon and AT T 
Some bulls are touting a turnaround story for CenturyLink due to its acquisition of Level 3 Communications  which admittedly did have a big impact on Q1 s top line  CTL reported a 41  year over year increase in revenues to  5 95 billion  But that s a natural effect from a bolt on acquisition  and that number in fact missed estimates of  5 96 billion  Meanwhile  higher expenses dragged on the bottom line  which dropped from 30 cents per share in the year ago quarter to just 11 cents 
CenturyLink at least is dredging itself out of the old wireline business and positioning itself more into high speed internet and business communications  But it pays out a dividend that it has not been able to cover with earnings for years  And while the picture is a little better when looking at the dividend versus its cash generation  it s still a tight fit that ensures the payout at the very least won t expand   and still may be a cut risk if the company itself can t organically grow 
CenturyLink s  CTL  Dividend Has Been Stretched for Years

Government Properties Income Trust  GOV  is a REIT that  as the name suggests  owns 108 properties in 31 states and the metro D C  area  and leases them out primarily to federal and other government tenants  Roughly 90  of the company s rental income comes from governmental entities 
Investors also should note that GOV owns a 28  stake in Select Income REIT  SIR   which specializes in  strategic  single tenant properties  think corporate headquarters  
You d think that government tenants would translate into stability  but at the moment you d be wrong 
The company s occupancy at the end of 2017 was 94 2   down from 95 1  at the end of 2016  Moreover  Government Properties says about 5  of its annual base rent is likely to be lost to vacancies over the next 12 months 
It s not a pretty picture elsewhere  First quarter FFO shrank from 56 cents per share to 55 cents  and same store net operating income fell 1 2  year over year  The company is selling assets in an attempt to fix its balance sheet  and while AFFO still is enough to cover the dividend  that figure is shrinking while its payout remains the same 
Government Properties Income Trust  GOV  Is Drowning in the Swamp
CBL   Associates Properties  CBL Dividend Yield  19 7 
There s no hard and fast rule on what constitutes a  dangerously high  yield  but I think it s safe to say that anything yielding around 20  or more should be looked at with a skeptical eye 
Enter CBL   Associates Properties  CBL  
CBL   Associates is a retail focused REIT that specializes in suburban town centers  At first blush  this isn t the worst place to be in retail   rather than being a pure play on stores  its properties also boast dining  entertainment and even health   wellness businesses 
Still  its locations appear far from immune to the troubles plaguing the broader retail space  The company saw adjusted funds from operations shrink from  2 41 per share in 2016 to  2 08 per share in 2017  That s plenty of room to cover its 20 cent quarterly dividend  but about that payout   it s about 25  lower than the last time I discussed CBL 
Despite being able to cover its then 26 5 cent quarterly payout with AFFO  CBL   Associates slashed the dividend last year amid declines in its core operational metric  sinking occupancy and lowered full year guidance  For the full year  same center net operating income declined 2 9    driven by revenue declines of  20 9 million primarily due to lower occupancy and rent reductions related to tenants in bankruptcy  
First quarter earnings released in April didn t provide much additional encouragement  FFO sank from 52 cents per share to 42 cents per share  with total portfolio same center NOI declining 6 8   and portfolio occupancy declining a full percentage point to 91 1  
It s difficult to say that CBL is necessarily a dividend cut risk given that  again  it s generating about double the AFFO needed to cover it  But it already cut back once under a similar circumstance  and the REIT clearly isn t cleaning up its mess 
CBL   Associates  CBL  Is Wearing Cement Shoes

305296,BA,Exclusive  Boeing eyes Lion Air crash software upgrade in 6 8 weeks,news,"By Eric M  Johnson and Tim Hepher SEATTLE PARIS  Reuters     Boeing Co   N BA  is weighing plans to launch a software upgrade for its 737 MAX in six to eight weeks that would help address a scenario faced by the Lion Air crew during last month s deadly crash in Indonesia  two people briefed on the matter said on Thursday  Crash investigators are focusing on the possibility that a new anti stall system that repeatedly pushed the Lion Air jetliner s nose down was being fed by erroneous data from a faulty sensor left in place after a previous hazardous flight  Boeing has said cockpit procedures that were applied on the previous flight are already in place to tackle such a problem  and that its 737 series remains safe to fly  But U S  regulators have said Boeing is also examining a possible software fix  after coming under fire for not outlining recent changes to the automated system in the manual for the 737 MAX  the latest version of its best selling passenger jet  While plans for the possible fix are not final  Boeing s software upgrade could block the recently modified anti stall system  known as MCAS  from continuously running until the plane hits its nose down limit  the sources said  The MCAS function would be disabled if the crew counteracted it by trimming or adjusting settings in the opposite direction  according to two people briefed on Boeing s proposals    When the crew makes the adjustment  that would essentially disengage MCAS unless it got new data   one of the people said  Data from the Lion Air flight recorder suggests the pilots sought to correct the system more than two dozen times before the jetliner plunged into the Java Sea on Oct  29  killing all 189 people onboard   Attention has focused on the role of a suspect  angle of attack  sensor used to drive alerts on stall or loss of lift  While each 737 has two of these blade shaped vanes  the plane s anti stall system relies on data pulled from just a single vane during each flight  compared with a three sensor  voting  system on rival Airbus  PA AIR  jetliners   Boeing s software update would come as an emergency measure from Boeing and Federal Aviation Administration  the sources said   SECOND PROBE  The specific system for preventing stalls was not originally designed to monitor both probes because regulators assumed risks of a mishap were small and would be further reduced by the presence of a trained crew and power switches on errant systems  Now  however  Boeing is examining whether the anti stall system should also check data from the second probe before engaging  according to a person briefed on the matter   Boeing declined comment on the proposed changes   As part of our standard practice following any accident or incident  we examine our aircraft design and operation  and when appropriate  issue bulletins and make recommendations to operators to further enhance safety   a Boeing spokeswoman said    Boeing continues to evaluate the need for software or other changes as we learn more from the ongoing investigation   The FAA has repeatedly said it will  take further action if findings from the accident investigation warrant   A decision to update the software has not been finalised and Boeing could choose a different strategy  the people said  The world s largest planemaker has 4 542 of the upgraded 737 MAX on order from airlines  worth over half a trillion dollars at list prices  or about half that after typical discounts

297322,MSFT,Can NVIDIA  NVDA  Stock Maintain Its Bull Run In 2020 ,opinion,NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   witnessed a turbulent ride in early 2019  thanks to weakness plaguing the gaming and datacenter markets  Moreover  deteriorating macro economic conditions and the US China trade war remained major dampeners Nonetheless  NVIDIA s confidence in its strategies and growth opportunities in ray traced gaming  rendering  high performance computing  AI and self driving cars  have helped the stock rebound in no time Notably  NVIDIA has been one of the outstanding performers in the semiconductor space this year  The stock has skyrocketed 76 4   outperforming the  growth of 37 6  as well as the S P 500 s 26  rally The company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four reported quarters  the average being 8 8  Fiscal 2021 Estimates Look ImpressiveThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2021 earnings  fiscal year ending January  is pegged at  7 21  indicating growth of 29 7  year over year Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2021 revenues is pegged at  12 86 billion  indicating growth of 19 44  year over year Let s check out the factors that are likely to boost the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock in the next year  You can see  Strengthening Gaming BusinessNVIDIA s fate is highly tied to its gaming segment  which remains the largest contributor to its revenues  Recovery in the segment backed by strength in both desktop and notebook gaming  which is largely driven by adoption of RTX GPUs  makes us optimistic Notably  NVIDIA has been instrumental in introducing real time ray tracing technology to the gaming world and its potent technology has provided the company with a substantial economic moat in this industry A spate of blockbuster AAA titles  which pledged support for NVIDIA RTX ray tracing technology  is a positive  During the last reported quarter  NVIDIA announced that Microsoft s   NASDAQ MSFT   Minecraft game will feature the technology  Further  the company believes  the recently released GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs will strengthen its leadership in the high end of the market Moreover  NVIDIA is making a big bet in the cloud gaming field with its platform GeForce Now The company is taking various initiatives to expand its footprint in the cloud gaming space  which is a positive NVIDIA Corporation Revenue  TTM    Recovery in Data Center BusinessData center presents solid growth opportunity for the company  As more and more businesses are shifting to cloud  the need for datacenters is increasing Moreover  growing adoption of Conversational AI among hyperscale customers is a key driver  NVIDIA believes Conversational AI to be a powerful catalyst for the company in both training and inference  Increasing adoption of Natural Language Processing by cloud players is an upside Further  the company s T4 GPU continues to gain adoption in public clouds  In September  Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   cloud computing arm  AWS  announced general availability of the T4 globally  following the T4 rollout on Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Google Cloud platform earlier in the year Considered most preferred by the datacenter operators  NVIDIA s GPUs are likely to help the company grab a larger market space  The company s acquisition of Mellanox  to be completed in early 2020  is likely to be a key catalyst in this regard Automotive Holds PromiseNVIDIA s steady focus on developing more updated AI technologies for self directed cars is making it well poised to become a leading provider of technology for autonomous vehicles  Development agreements with automakers like Mercedes Benz  Toyota and Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  s Audi unit is a key driver Recently  at GTC China  the company introduced a highly advanced software defined platform  NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin for autonomous vehicles and robots  The new system on a chip  SoC  Orin  which packs 17 billion transistors  delivers seven times the performance of the company s previous generation  Xavier SoC Bottom LineWith the proliferation of AI  growing adoption of NVIDIA s GPUs in various end markets is likely to remain the key catalyst  By applying its GPUs in the AI models  the company is expanding its footprint in not just data center and gaming markets but other untapped markets like automotive  healthcare and manufacturing  which will support its earnings and revenues in the years to come Further  a stable U S  economy and a partial trade deal with China makes us optimistic Moreover  the company s huge cash balance of approximately  9 77 billion as of Oct 27 made it easier for it to fund its growth initiatives  such as investments in research and developments  sales and marketing as well as acquisitions  thereby raising our optimism on the stock Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2020In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 top tickers for the entirety of 2020

285239,AAPL,Stocks Near 52 Week Lows  4 Attractive Picks,opinion,Markets typically overreact to good and bad tidings  resulting in arbitrary stock price movements that do not always match up with a company s fundamentals Just as there are a number of companies that are breezing past their fair value  there are potentially underpriced ones that are trading way below their intrinsic value The old school investors often wary and would rather have nothing to do with stocks wobbling at 52 week lows However  this contrarian strategy might actually help investors lower downside risk while achieving market outperformance  The aim is to hunt for stocks that have sufficient long term growth prospects to transcend near term pressure Are These Stocks Still Worth Betting On Investors usually avoid beaten down stocks in order to follow the trend  In fact  they don t reason that the stocks might have lost more value due to temporary company specific or macroeconomic issues  which might even change in the near future Whether a stock is cheap or expensive should be ascertained by the company s ability to deliver superior performance in the long run  Thus  rather than assessing a stock based on price patterns  one should evaluate it as a business Thus  low valuations do not always mean that the stock has lost all potential  Sometimes  it is an opportunity for investors to make positions in stocks which are trading at a bargain and have immense potential 4 Fallen Angels to Grab NowWe hereby zero in on five stocks based on the following credentials  a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   current price as a percentage of the 52 week high low range under 5  a value of 0 indicates that the stock is trading at its 52 week low   and a Growth Score of A or B on our  Please note that our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from a company s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth  Back tested results show that stocks with Growth Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space  You can see  Furthermore  the following picks have been witnessing impressive earnings estimate revision activity  of late  which implies that analysts are increasingly bullish on these stocks Turtle Beach Corporation   NASDAQ HEAR  Based in New York  Turtle Beach is an audio technology company  The stock is currently meandering around its one year low of 56 cents The company is focused on developing its eSports presence and laying the groundwork for future growth opportunities in PC headsets  China and new categories like Virtual Reality  Moreover  its long term objective is to leverage these additional growth opportunities to drive double digit revenue growth as they continue to expect mid single digits growth in the console gaming headset market  over the coming years In fact  given the company s solid lineup of new games and product launches as well as emphasis on sound cost saving measures  Turtle Beach also raised its 2017 outlook at its last quarterly conference call Meanwhile  analysts have revised their current year earnings estimates upward by 22 2  over the past month  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year projects earnings growth of 80 3  from the prior year Currently  Turtle Beach holds a Zacks Rank  2 and a solid Growth Score of A  Also  the company has surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  recording an average beat of 33 06  All these factors make us reasonably confident of outperformance in the near term TearLab Corporation   NASDAQ TEAR  California based TearLab operates an in vitro diagnostic company in the United States We remain positive on the company s launch of TearLab Discovery platform  The launch is expected to create an inflection point for the company s business through both increased utilization within its current customer base as well as expansion of its footprint into new accounts that have not yet adopted point of care testing Though the stock is currently looming slightly above its 52 week low of  1 20  its Zacks Rank  2 and a firm Growth Score of A further adds optimism in the stock Adding to the positives  TearLab has been enjoying solid earnings estimate revisions  Over the past month  its current year estimates have narrowed from a loss of  2 82 to a loss of  2 68 per share  Also  the company is expected to grow its 2017 earnings by 37 5  year over year Notably  the company has a mostly positive track record of earnings surprises in the past four quarters  with an average beat of 5 63  Celsion Corporation   NASDAQ CLSN  Based in Lawrenceville  NJ  Celsion is an oncology company committed to developing a portfolio of innovative cancer treatments including directed chemotherapies  immunotherapies and RNA  or DNA based therapies Currently  the company is trading near its 52 week low of  1 24 Nevertheless  we are positive on the company s lead product programs including ThermoDox in liver cancer and GEN 1 in ovarian cancer Celsion also holds a favorable Zacks Rank  2 and an equally impressive Growth Score of B  Moreover  the stock has been witnessing positive estimate revisions over the past month as the current year estimate of loss has narrowed 12 5  over the same time frame Further  the company s 2017 EPS is expected to grow a whopping 77 7  year over year Energy Focus  Inc    NASDAQ EFOI  Energy Focus is a leading provider and innovator of energy efficient LED lighting products  As a longstanding partner with the U S  Government  the company provides energy efficient LED lighting products to the U S  Navy and the Military Sealift Command fleets  among other commercial customers Currently  the company is trading near its 52 week low of  1 51 The company s nationwide network of sales agents and channel partners  expanding geographical coverage and a solid product pipeline all come together to provide a long term revenue growth engine  Meanwhile  Energy Focus continues to focus on maximizing operating cost savings  which should translate to better margins Furthermore  carrying a Zacks Rank  2 and a Growth Score of A  this firm has seen positive estimate revisions over the past month  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 narrowed from a loss of  1 14 per share to a loss of  1 02 per share  Notably  the company s 2017 EPS is expected to rise 2 9  year over year To ConcludeIndeed  the aforementioned stocks reeling around their 52 week lows can actually turn out to be an opportunity for investors  taking portfolio returns to new highs   if only  they remain patient and trust the study of fundamentals More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could

403806,ABT,Novo Nordisk  NVO  Reports Positive Trial Results On Victoza,opinion,"Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb    NYSE NVO   announced results from the LEADER trial on Victoza at the American Diabetes Association s 76th Scientific Sessions 
Results were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine 
The trial is evaluating the long term effects of Victoza  in comparison to placebo  both in addition to the standard of care  in people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of major cardiovascular  CV  events 
Results from the multicenter  international  randomized  double blinded  placebo controlled trial showed that Victoza significantly reduced the risk of the composite primary endpoint of CV death  non fatal myocardial infarction  heart attack  or non fatal stroke by 13   compared to placebo  when added to the standard of care in adults with type II diabetes at high CV risk 
Results also showed that treatment with Victoza resulted in a 22  reduction in cardiovascular death  compared to placebo 
This means that Victoza can improve outcomes beyond glucose reduction and weight loss in reducing cardiovascular complications and death in people with type II diabetes NOVO NORDISK AS Price
   We note that Victoza is indicated in Europe for the treatment of adults with type II diabetes to achieve glycemic control as monotherapy  when metformin is considered inappropriate  and in combination with oral glucose lowering medicinal products and or basal insulin when these  together with diet and exercise  do not provide adequate glycemic control  The drug is also approved in the U S  as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood glucose control in adults with type II diabetes 
These results bode well for Victoza  We note that Novo Nordisk has a strong presence in the diabetes care market  supported by one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry comprising drugs like Victoza  Levemir and modern insulins

283216,AAPL,E Trade Financial  Vitamin Shoppe And Netflix Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Jan 18  2018    highlights E Trade Financial   NASDAQ ETFC   as the Bull of the Day  Vitamin Shoppe   NYSE VSI   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX   Here is a synopsis of all three stocks   The tax cut has the stock market going supernova  Yesterday was the first time in history the Dow closed over 26 000  There is no other industry that is cheering on this market rally more than financial services  More trading and higher asset prices spells big profits for companies like today s Bull of the Day  E Trade Financial E Trade Financial Corporation  a financial services company  provides brokerage and related products and services primarily to individual retail investors under the E Trade Financial brand  It also offers investor focused banking products  primarily deposits to retail investors  and financial corporate services  such as software and services for managing equity compensation plans to its corporate clients  The company is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in an industry that ranks in the Top 11  of our Zacks Industry Rank  The reason for the bullish Zacks Rank is the activity of analysts covering the stock  Over the last month  six analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter  current year and next year while no analysts have dropped their numbers This has pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from  2 26 to  2 28  while next year s number has swelled from  2 52 to  3 11  Earnings are estimated to grow at a 44  clip year over year this quarter  Next year analysts are betting on 36 42  earnings growth  Revenues for next year are slated to grow at 12 12   Avoiding retail like the plague has been a good motto for investors  Not retail categorically across the board  but those little pockets of retail that seem like they are on their way out  I m not saying that today s Bear of the Day is going the way of the dodo bird  I m just saying that will all this money sloshing around the market there are easier places to make a buck I m talking about Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Vitamin Shoppe  Vitamin Shoppe  Inc   through its subsidiaries  operates as a multi channel specialty retailer and contract manufacturer of nutritional products in the United States and internationally  It operates through three segments  Retail  Direct  and Manufacturing  The company provides custom manufacturing and private labeling services for VMS products  as well as develops and markets own branded products  It offers vitamins  minerals  herbs  specialty supplements  sports nutrition  and other health and wellness products of approximately 900 brands  such as own brands comprising Vitamin Shoppe  BodyTech  True Athlete  Mytrition  plnt  ProBioCare  Next Step  and Betancourt Nutrition  and national brands  including Optimum Nutrition  Cellucor  Garden of Life  Quest Nutrition  Solaray  Solgar  and Nature s Way  Growth numbers across the board are in the gutter for Vitamin Shoppe  The current quarter revenue contraction is expected to be close to 14   A year ago  the company made 36 cents for the quarter  this year they are looking at a 24 cent loss  Analysts have been dropping their earnings estimates for the stock  resulting in the unfavorable Zacks Rank  The current year Zacks Consensus Estimate has gone from 72 cents to 34 cents while next year s number has plummeted from 69 cents to 30 cents Additional Content Bitcoin Loses a Netflix Worth of Market CapThe multi day cryptocurrency selloff continued on Wednesday  with several notable coins including bitcoin  Ethereum  Ripple  Litecoin  and Bitcoin Cash once again experiencing sharp declines  Experienced crypto traders are no strangers to sudden drops  but the scope and severity of this particular January crash has many concerned According to   the price of bitcoin has tumbled nearly 16  over the past 24 hours  Ethereum  Litecoin  and Bitcoin Cash have all dropped more than 20  within that same timeframe  while Ripple has crashed more than 25  Wednesday s losses add to what has been a terrible week for the vast majority of the world s cryptocurrencies  After reaching a weekly high on Saturday  the 1 442 cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap have since shed about  330 billion worth of total market capitalization The crash becomes even more maddening when looking at the price action of bitcoin specifically  At its lowest point on Wednesday morning  bitcoin s total market cap was about  158 billion a far cry from the  252 billion it was at as recently as last week Bitcoin has bounced off that weekly low a bit  but there was a moment this morning where the world s most popular cryptocurrency was down about  95 billion on the week  Having trouble visualizing just how big of a drop that is   95 billion is about equal to the current market cap of Netflix Proponents of bitcoin will quickly point out that the  January crash  is not a new phenomenon  Indeed  over the last several years  bitcoin has tumbled significantly from new highs in the month of January in direct contrast to the New Year bullishness we typically see on the stock market But with the significant surge in bitcoin over the past year  this year s January crash comes at a moment when the stakes have never been higher Nevertheless  it is worth noting that Wednesday s intraday low for total cryptocurrency market cap is relatively in line with what the crypto market was trading at just 23 days ago  As promised  the cryptocurrency market continues to witness significant fluctuations New traders might be getting burned if this is their first time experiencing it  but we continue to see that anyone that presumes to know where bitcoin is heading next is typically overconfident Want more

357308,LMT,Growth and Value  Esterline Technologies   a Leading Defense Contractor,opinion,Investing versus SpeculatingWith the amount of volatility seen in the equity markets today  many people seem to believe that the old proven practices of investing in solid businesses for the long run no longer apply   But it s important to remember that there is a significant distinction between true investing and speculating   And it s even more important to recognize that the level of risk taken by speculators is significantly greater than the amount of risk assumed by investors Although there are famous speculators  the average investor would not have the appetite for risk or the steely nerves that speculation requires   On the other hand  most of the great icons of sound and prudent investing practices offer insights and strategies that are as much common sense and prudent behavior  as they are genius   Therefore  the everyday investor is capable of applying their insights and lessons  and therefore achieving their own low risk investment success Famous investors like Warren Buffett  Philip Fisher  Peter Lynch  Bill Miller  John Neff  Sir John Templeton  Thomas Rowe Price and Bill Ruane are just a sampling of many great prudent investors who believe in investing in good businesses rather than speculating in the stock market   Then of course there is Ben Graham  who taught many of the above mentioned investing greats and offered us one of my favorite quotes to share   in the short run the market is a voting machine  but in the long run it s a weighing machine  Speculators focus on stock price movement and attempt to guess the magnitude and direction where the price of the market or a company may go next  Speculators tend to be very active traders  and therefore  tend to ignore  or at least pay very little attention to the fundamentals of the business  Consequently  the trader speculator  deals with the voting machine or short run market that Mr  Graham spoke about  To me at least  this turns the stock market into a casino  and trading is closer to gambling than it is to prudent behavior In contrast  sound investors are interested in owning the business and therefore take a longer term approach   Since they do not intend to sell the business they invest in for a long period of time  short term market volatility concerns them very little  Consequently  investors are interested in the  weight  of the business  and therefore carefully scrutinize the fundamentals underpinning the companies they are interested in  To prudent investors  the stock market merely represents the store where they can find good businesses to buy and hold for the long run   Once they buy their business  the store they bought it in is no longer of any interest to them  Esterline Technologies   Solid Fundamentals on SaleAs I was recently shopping in the stock market store  I came across a very interesting business in the aerospace defense industry that I believe is currently on sale   This is a growth business with solid fundamentals and a compelling thesis for continued above average growth   However  since it operates in the defense industry  many investors  mistakenly in my opinion  seem to believe that cuts in defense spending would curtail or eliminate this company s growth potential   Consequently  I believe this quality company is being mispriced by Mr  Market  and is currently significantly undervalued The following slides from their Investor and Analyst Day Conference presentation on September 15  2011 summarizes their businesses and geographic exposure  In addition to offering a balanced business mix by end market  Esterline Technologies  ESL  is not just dependent on the U S  market  as half their business is done outside the United States When reviewing this company based solely on fundamentals we discover that Esterline Technologies  ESL  has generated a 9 2  earnings growth rate over the past 15 years  since calendar year 1997    However  since numbers alone do not always tell the whole story  a quick glance at their earnings record illustrates a sharp acceleration in earnings growth since calendar year 2004 Esterline Technologies  earnings growth rate has accelerated to over 18 6  per annum over the time period 2005 to 2011   Most importantly  this time period includes the great recession of 2008   It s also important to acknowledge modest cyclicality within their operating results where earnings have occasionally flattened and even modestly fell in fiscal year 2009   However  after falling slightly  earnings accelerated once again in 2010 and 2011   A little cyclicality does not bother me  because like Warren Buffett  I am interested in an above average growth rate of 15  or better even if it s a little lumpy  Nevertheless  the voting machine short term market has found cause to price their shares at a significantly discounted PE ratio of only 10 7   A similar reaction by the market during the middle of 2008 to the spring of 2009 resulted in an excellent opportunity to buy this growing business on sale Esterline Technologies   Thesis for GrowthNine analysts reporting to Capital IQ expect Esterline Technologies  ESL  to grow earnings at 15  per annum over the next five years   If they were to achieve those earnings results and the stock was awarded a PE ratio expansion to a PEG ratio PE of 15  then investors could expect to earn in excess of 20  per annum on their investment  The following estimated earnings and return calculator illustrates that potential We believe the consensus estimates of future earnings growth for Esterline Technologies  ESL  are both reasonable and achievable for several reasons  First of all  we expect strong organic growth based on the fact that Esterline s products are attractively positioned to meet the most critical needs of their key customers  This would include fuel efficient consumer and business jets  modern high speed rail lines and advanced surveillance systems  The following four slides from their Investor and Analyst Day Conference on September 11  2011 highlight their opportunity The final thesis behind our confidence in Esterline s ability to achieve their earnings growth are their numerous potential acquisition opportunities   Over the past decade  Esterline has acquired over 30 strategic acquisitions  and their largest acquisition was completed in late July of 2011  They purchased France based Souriau Group for over  700 million in cash and expect this acquisition to increase fiscal 2012 earnings by over   40 a share The following  and final slide  from their investor and analyst day conference provides their guidance on high single digit long term acquisition growth rates  When you combine their guidance for high single digit organic growth with their expected acquisition growth  the consensus estimated earnings growth rate of 15  becomes very plausible ConclusionsWe believe that there are several attractive candidates in the aerospace defense industry   Names would include General Dynamics  GD   Rockwell Collins  COL   Boeing  BA   Lockheed Martin  LMT   United Technologies  UTX   L 3 Communications Holdings  LLL  and many others   However  of this entire sector  it appears that Esterline Technologies  ESL  offers the largest opportunity for future earnings growth based on its well positioned product line up and geographically diverse base  In fact  many of the companies mentioned represent important customers of Esterline Technologies On the other hand  unlike most of the other major players in the aerospace defense industry  Esterline Technologies does not pay a dividend   Instead  the company appears more focused on strategic acquisitions to grow their business and reward shareholders through growth  Therefore  Esterline Technologies  shares are more appropriate for the investors interested in the potential for above average growth at a reasonable price  Finally  Esterline Technologies is offered as an opportunity for the prudent investor to build a long term position in a high quality growing business  and therefore  is not offered as a trading vehicle   Esterline Technologies is presented as a high quality growing business that is currently on sale Disclosure   Long UTX  LLL at the time of writing Disclaimer  The opinions in this document are for

We never owned Emerging Markets for clients until Q1  16  when the 10 year return on the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF  NYSE VWO  and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  NYSE EEM  both turned negative  Josh Brown over at the Reformed Broker started writing about the outflows from the Emerging Markets space in late 2015  which was a reaction to the China devaluation meltdown in late July   early August  15  That started getting us interested in the space   Pimco also made a prescient call on EM s in the Spring of  16 too   it was written about   
Part of the lack of appeal of the asset class is that these countries are commodity based economies  with a lot of debt and heavily tied to Energy too  and well  none of those asset classes did well in the disinflation that followed 2008 
Brazil was truly unique since not only did it have ties to Energy via Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras SA DRC  NYSE PBR  and the grain markets via soybeans exports  etc   look at how Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and Deere  NYSE DE  performed post 2008  but you had the corruption trial of Dilma Rousseff occurring just as Energy and commodity prices were melting down in late 2015  early 2016 
The iShares MSCI Brazil Capped Fund  NYSE EWZ  was too good to pass up and we took a position in it for clients in early  2016  to the tune of 1  2  of client accounts 
Brazil and the EWZ was the poster child for commodity price pressure  weak currency  a corrupt socialist government  and much more 
The above chart looks like EWZ is on the verge of breaking out if its 8 9 year downtrend off the 2007 highs near  102 in May  2008  EWZ turned up as Rousseff left office  and a more free market  business oriented government took over 
One of the few things I did right pre 2008  besides not owning any housing or residential real estate directly for clients  was that clients were kept out of the very hot commodity and Emerging Market and China plays that attracted so much money from 2000 2008  The EWZ fell  70 or roughly 70  in value from May  08 through October  08 
While the above chart shows  40 could be tough resistance  watch how that key price level plays out 
The VWO  EEM and the EWZ all look like they are trying to move out of long term downtrends  The lowest client cost basis on the EWZ is roughly  20  with the majority bought around  27  28 
Total exposure to the asset class is probably between 3  5  of client accounts  depending on the client 
A  return to global growth  theme and a return to faster GDP growth around the globe  and some reflation  I think bodes very well for this asset class 
Emerging Markets at least in the near term will likely be more closely correlated to the S P 500 too ",2017-02-16,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/brazil-and-emerging-markets-–-muy-bueno-200175861,200175861

388289,CAT,Caterpillar to Share More Cash  Boosting Dividend 20  to Record,news," Bloomberg      Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   is sharing the wealth with investors  announcing a 20 percent increase in its quarterly dividend that takes it to a record 
The heavy equipment maker expects to increase the dividend in each of the following four years by  at least a high single digit percentage   With its remaining free cash flow  the company intends to repurchase shares  on a more consistent basis   it said in a statement Thursday 
Key Insights

In the first quarter  the Deerfield  Illinois based manufacturer reported profit and sales that beat estimates  driven by a boost from mining orders 
The company had  7 1 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter after buying back  751 million of its common shares and paying dividends of  494 million 
CFO Andrew Bonfield has said sales could rise more  rapidly  this year as mining companies boost capital spending and replace aging equipment  Dealers inventories in the resource industries have fallen 
The world s largest construction and mining equipment maker is considered a bellwether for economic growth  That makes its shares particularly vulnerable to trade tensions and fears of a global slowdown 

Market Reaction

The statement was released before the start of regular trading in New York  where Caterpillar shares climbed 0 8 percent

410635,NEM,Get Out Of Crypto And Move Into Gold And Silver ,opinion,"Summary
1 2018 has seen so much volatility in the equity and bond markets after going straight up since 2009 
2  Everything  bubble is simply the result of record low negative real rates manipulated by Central Bankers to prevent deflation by all means possible 
3 The ending of QE combined with increasingly inflationary concerns has sparked the US to start raising rates 
4 Unwinding of easy money policies could be quite painful 
5 Stay away from margin and company s with any debt on their books 
One of the most overlooked stories in 2018 has been the volatility in equity and bond markets  The  everything  bubble is simply the result of record low negative real rates manipulated by Central Bankers to prevent deflation by all means possible  In 2008  the US banks were on the verge of collapse  the Fed since that time has tried every effort to protect the economy with easy money policies 

The result since 2008 has been remarkably effective  Unemployment in the USA is at record lows only ten years following the government bailouts of banks and the auto sector  The real estate foreclosure crisis has been completely turned around 
We must not forget that for every action there is a reaction  The unwinding of easy money policies could be quite painful  The ending of QE combined with increasingly inflationary concerns has sparked the US to start raising rates  10 year are now the highest in many years spiking higher taking the investment world by storm  Real interest rate hikes are happening for the first time in many years  The Fed has started warning investors about rising risks most notably recently with Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  

First hit is now Italy who has always lived the sweet life heavily indebted  Next will be Greece or maybe Spain or Portugal and the PIIGS as interest rates increase  Don t worry about Spain  Greece and Italy they will be bailed out by the EU again with another lifeline  Instead  be concerned for many young people living in debt  They may have jobs now with record low unemployment  Nevertheless  in many cities such as NYC  LA and Miami the average teacher can t afford a place to live 

As rates rise again to historic levels  I expect to see many more delinquencies  The recent concerns at Deutsche Bank may be just the beginning 
I remember how fast these bank panics happen  First it started with Bear Sterns then Lehman and then AIG  All during that time the pundits in the mainstream media said there was nothing to worry about and that housing and the markets were booming forever and ever 
A similar phenomenon could be happening right now  We have so many warning signs of another crash  The biggest one is the major increase in bond yields in 2018  Not only have rates moved higher but it jumped quickly the most in many years 
I expect the recent warning signs from the Fed Reserve on Deutsche Bank to be just the beginning as debtors who became over leveraged to low rates pay the price now as rates rise quickly  I don t believe the Fed is done raising rates until there is a severe market downturn 
There is no doubt that highly leveraged borrowers at record low interest rates will come into trouble  This begs the question how many of the banks still have derivative exposure like AIG and Lehman 
Remember statistically we have up to 50  corrections or more once every 10 years or so  I know you don t like to hear it but this is the second longest bull market since the 1920 s which led up to a major crash and the Great Depression  We are in the midst of trade wars not seen in 100 year since the Smoot Hawley Era which many blame as one of the accelerants in deepening the Great Depression s devastating effects 
How does one protect oneself  Stay away from margin and company s with any debt on their books  You might want to look at hedging against the financials  real estate and bonds  TBT   Stick to small cap stories with no debt over large caps with debt and look to see if they have real assets preferably in the form of some sort of commodity in the ground  The mining sector  GDX  NYSE GDX   which has been under attack by the activists and unloved for years may actually be one of the best places especially gold  GDX   silver  SIL  and copper miners  COPX   The energy  XLE  and agriculture  DBA  sector may also be safe areas which over time could outperform during a potential bear market panic 

Conditions point to a bear market and possible flash crash this summer  Please prepare for real estate and stock market valuation to come back to earth as rates move higher 
What is deeply discounted right now and could soar again if we see double digit inflation like in the 1970 s  The junior miners could be the best place especially right now the beaten down exploration stocks which have been brutally neglected by the major producers for years  I recently went to a mining conference in NYC put on by 121 Mining and met with some of the top CEO s and Fund Managers 
One of my really smart professional subscribers Art pointed out Shanquan Li  Mr  Li manages the Oppenheimer Gold and Specialty Minerals  OGPSX  Before entering the investment sector he was a director of a think tank for the Chinese Government and then joined Brown Brothers Harriman before joining Oppenheimer where he has been for 22 years managing the precious metals fund since 1997 building it to just under  1 billion under management  He has significantly outperformed his peers recently with picks such as Kirkland Lake  KL  Endeavour  EDV and Newmont  NEM  The fund pays a yield of 2 99  and has four stars from Morningstar  Over the past year Li s  OGPSX fund has stayed in positive territory while most mining funds have been down 
He mentioned to me he doesn t buy stocks until they reach a minimum market cap but he does like to follow them and start doing research at an early stage  He comes to these shows because he realizes in his experience as a portfolio manager that big miners start out little and grow  He is smart  humble and constantly looking as he does not want to miss some big discoveries in the junior mining sector  This may be an actively managed fund that I may look into  Check out this recent interview with Oppenheimer Portfolio Manager Shanquan Li here 
At the conference I had dozens of meetings with juniors  One of the things that impacted me most was when the CEO s showed up and mentioned to me that they were recently buying their own shares  This is a very bullish testament to me as an investor and it was nice to see two of the CEO s telling me that they are putting heavy amounts of their own net worth in recently as they believe their own stock has value and should rise  I m still doing due diligence to confirm what they are telling me is correct but Liberty Gold  LGD and Victoria Gold  VIT may have had some recent insider buying  If you find insider report please email it to me 
There were a few select juniors showing some great momentum at the conference based on prior results and good discoveries this included Teranga  TGZ  Fireweed Zinc  FWZ  Corvus  KOR and Silvercrest  SIL 
Many of the companies came to the conference already well positioned financially recently raising money such as GoviEx Uranium  GXU  Some recently announced financings like Alexco  AXU which seems to be a top takeout target for high grade silver companies 
Interestingly  many investors are still unaware of the recent investment by Eric Sprott into what could be the next Novo which went up ten fold last year  Sprott just made a  10 million investment in a small company which is just starting to pick up  The CEO was just interviewed and was one of the first I ve seen on this rising junior in the Pilbara in Western Australia 
Also incredibly I spoke to some of the top lithium experts on the internet and they were not aware of a discovery that I was one of the first in the industry to highlight back in November last year which could be huge  Since that time they raised  2 5 mil CAD and are advancing permitting and metallurgy  The stock has gone from a quarter to 1  and it could be just a start as there have recently been some major advancements with the permitting 
Make sure to stay tuned as I expect a positive turn in the mining market to be imminent  Be careful of the overbought cannabis and cryptocurrency sector which has attracted a lot of speculative capital and tons of fraudsters  See the recent article entitled   Buyer Beware  Hundreds of Bitcoin Wannabes Show Hallmarks of Fraud  or  SEC Tells Investors Potential For Fraud in Companies Tied to Cannabis Industry   Please be careful   caveat emptor  If you have gains in cannabis or crypto  it might be prudent to rotate into cheap mining stocks

318181,TGT,Investors eye holiday sales for market salve,news,"By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors will get a glimpse of consumer health next week as the holiday shopping season gets under way with Black Friday sales  and a solid start could help equities steady after several tumultuous weeks   The day after Thanksgiving has been regarded as the traditional start of the holiday buying season  although deals and bargains are being unveiled earlier this year  Wall Street has been struggling with uncertainty over U S  congressional midterm elections  the path of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve  tariffs  the trade war and the possibility corporate earnings have already peaked  But a strong start to the gift buying season could help ease some concerns  After an October that saw the S P 500  SPX  slump nearly 7 percent  Wall Street has struggled to find its footing  rising 0 7 percent so far in November  That puts the index on pace for its biggest quarterly loss since the third quarter of 2015 and its worst fourth quarter performance in a decade   About 38 percent of American consumers plan to shop on Black Friday this year  and six in 10 of those shoppers anticipate making at least half of their holiday purchases on that day  a Reuters Ipsos poll showed on Thursday    Of all the other factors  the consumer has been hanging in there   they drove third quarter growth  we are seeing wage growth over 3 percent  financing rates are still reasonable   said Jack Ablin  chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago    If we see any kind of disappointment in Black Friday sales  that is going to cause some real concern   Same store sales for the fourth quarter are expected to come in at a healthy 3 percent  according to Refinitiv data  Still  that number is trending downward from the previous two quarters and is slightly below the year ago result of 3 1 percent   Refinitiv same store sales index    A strong start to holiday sales might not translate to strong earnings  however  reinforcing concerns about the best of corporate profits being in the rear view mirror as retailers have to grapple with deal conscious consumers    Even a healthy consumer doesn t necessarily mean that retail sales and profitability and performance will be off the charts   said Shawn Kravetz  president of Esplanade Capital in Boston  who spoke at the Reuters Global Investment 2019 Outlook Summit in New York this week  Muddying the picture was data on Thursday that showed U S  retail sales rebounded sharply in October  boosted by purchases of motor vehicles and building materials  but the prior two months were revised lower and the trend indicated slower consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity in the country  Big name retailers such as  Target   N TGT   Lowe s Companies  N LOW  and Gap Inc  N GPS  are expected to report quarterly results next week and investors will watch for any guidance for the holiday season   Still  a strong start to the holiday shopping season will only partially alleviate investor concerns  with a G20 meeting at the end of November and the final Fed policy announcement of the year in December likely to cause some market volatility  The market will need to digest these events for it to have a chance for what is known as a Santa Claus rally  Since 1950  the S P has rallied in December three fourths of the time  according to the Stock Traders Almanac  The benchmark index has gained an average of 1 6 percent for December  the best month of the year

324617,TGT,COLUMN A reality check from Standard   Poor s  Neil Collins,news,"   Neil Collins is a Reuters columnist  The views expressed are
his own   
 
 By Neil Collins
 LONDON  May 21  Reuters    Standard   Poor s could have
chosen a better day to kick the British economy  by placing the
UK onto  negative outlook   the usual precursor to a downgrade
of S P s rating of an issuer s debt 
 The move came minutes before the Debt Management Office
closed its massive auction of 5 billion pounds of 2014 stock 
and minutes after the release of figures showing the Public
Sector Net Borrowing Requirement leaping to 8 5 billion pounds
in April  a sum which not long ago would have been considered
high for a whole year 
 Economist Howard Archer at Global Insight immediately called
the figure  dire  starting the new fiscal year off as it is
highly likely to continue  
 S P  meanwhile  now fears that the net general government
debt burden  could approach 100 percent of GDP and remain near
that level in the medium term  
 It s hard to describe the UK public finances as anything
other than a disaster area  The forecasts made in last month s
Budget looked optimistic within days  and even these require the
DMO to borrow 220 billion pounds this financial year  or almost
a billion pounds every working day 
 Yet while the DMO soaks up cash  the Bank of England is
desperately creating it  Its  quantitative easing  programme has
been in full swing this week  buying in 1 326 billion pounds of
a stock which looks very like the one that the DMO was issuing
just one day later 
 The experts will tell you that because the life of the new
stock is not quite five years  it falls outside the Bank s five
to 25 year target zone for QE  and is therefore qualitatively
different  This is pure mumbo jumbo  Essentially what is
happening is one arm of the government is creating money for
another arm of the government to borrow 
 The traders can hardly believe their luck  selling
expensively to the Bank and buying cheaply from the DMO 
 This waste of taxpayers  money would be bad enough  but the
real damage is the false sense of security this round tripping
produces  Britain is in real danger of falling into a debt trap 
where the cost of borrowing spirals up with the amount the
government has to raise 
 As the rating agency s reality check concludes   A
government debt burden  of nearly 100 percent of GDP  if
sustained  would in S P s view be incompatible with an AAA
rating  
 Loss of that rating would lead to a higher cost of
government borrowing  damaging the chances of avoiding the trap 
 Were the Labour administration not in total funk  it might
seize on this report to admit that its spending plans are not
sustainable  Capital projects  like the NHS IT scheme  ID cards 
Crossrail  aircraft carriers  the Eurofighter and much else will
have to go  and the next government will have to impose real
cuts in the core spending of education  health and welfare 
 S P s warning shot shows that the phoney war is over  and
the real pain lies ahead ",2009-05-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/column-a-reality-check-from-standard---poor's:-neil-collins-56593,56593
310853,NFLX,For indie filmmakers theatrical release is an avenue to digital success,news,By Piya Sinha Roy PARK CITY  Utah  Reuters    Amid the snow covered streets of Park City  Utah  the fates of numerous films lie in the hands of film executives as they place bets on which movies screened at the annual Sundance Film Festival will be the next big box office hit  For independent filmmakers  the big screen still holds supreme  But it can also be used to drum up a larger audience on digital platforms  The trend comes as digital companies such as Amazon com Inc and IAC InterActiveCorp s Vimeo are looking to acquire movies as they compete  or partner with  film studios for a bigger audience share   Brothers Mark and Jay Duplass  known for movies such as  Jeff Who Lives At Home   sold three films at Sundance this year  including  Tangerine  and  The Overnight   and all are heading to the big screen  The cost of a theatrical release  including distribution and spending on press and advertising  raises the threshold for achieving success  By comparison  a digital release is less costly for filmmakers and could offer a bigger payout if a movie becomes a hit  While  Tangerine  doesn t have big stars  it can grow through strong reviews  Mark Duplass said   The Overnight   starring Adam Scott and Jason  could have gone straight to digital release  but Duplass said it was worth  taking a risk  on the cost of a theatrical release   When I see a movie that can really break out at the movie theaters  I feel like I do want to give it a chance   he said  But a digital release can work alongside a theatrical release and capitalize on the box office   The Duplass brothers last week signed a deal to produce four films exclusively for Netflix Inc s subscription based digital streaming service  but with an option to show them at movie theaters beforehand  Similarly  talent agency William Morris Endeavor is opting for theatrical releases in most cases  while also finding ways to pair with the digital world  Out of the 16 films that William Morris Endeavor has for sale at Sundance this year  only two so far have been sold in a multi platform deal  in which a film is released simultaneously in theaters and on digital and VOD platforms   The rest are all theatrical releases  though Graham Taylor  head of film financing and distribution at William Morris Endeavor  is an advocate of narrowing the window between a film s theatrical release and subsequent digital  VOD and home entertainment release   There is a cost efficiency  to using the money spent ahead of a movie s debut at theaters to tie into digital release soon after  he said  DOUBLING AUDIENCE ACCESS Joe Swanberg  director of this year s Sundance film  Digging For Fire   said he shot it on 35mm film specifically to show at movie theaters   But he acknowledged that a digital platform may be the right fit for certain movies  While his 2014 film  Happy Christmas  made only  30 000 across nine U S  theaters  it found its audience on Netflix  he said   Theatrical release is a really nice commercial for your movie  but also closing those windows between theatrical and digital isn t cannibalization   he said   You re just doubling your access to an audience   Netflix has 57 million subscribers worldwide and its clients have watched more independent films than on any other digital platform  said Jonathan Friedland  the company s chief communications officer   The economics of going the traditional theatrical release route are somewhat unfavorable for filmmakers   Friedland said   And even as movie theaters remain a favored debut venue for many indie films  digital platforms offer the advantage of identifying and targeting a specific audience       A lot of people are going direct to digital and this makes sense for documentaries or films that have a subject that clearly has a passionate audience dispersed around the world   said Vimeo Chief Executive Officer Kerry Trainor      Unlike subscription based Netflix  Vimeo is an open  high end video sharing site that allows people to charge for their content  It has 26 million subscribers      Director Spike Lee debuted his latest film   Da Sweet Blood of Jesus   on Vimeo a month before its scheduled Feb  13 theatrical release  pricing rentals at  9 99 and purchases at  14 99       This is the future of film distribution  Please join us   Lee said in a statement ,2015-01-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/for-indie-filmmakers-theatrical-release-is-an-avenue-to-digital-success-325897,325897

 NikkeiAsianReview  The standard expectation that a weakening yen lifts Japanese stock prices has not been borne out in recent months 
With the U S  Federal Open Market Committee widely anticipated to hike the key interest rate at its meeting next week  many market participants see the Japanese currency softening against the dollar in the long term  Still  the view that it could strengthen in the short term has prompted investors to steer clear of exporter stocks for now  But they may want to note the recent shift in the relationship between Japanese shares and the yen s exchange rate 
The Nikkei declined through its Broadening Wedge 

The Nikkei declined through the lower trendline of its Broadening Wedge at 19475 00  A decline beneath the Broadening formation implies a probable 20  correction may follow  A probable reversal appears to be underway  with weakness in the Cycle showing for the next two weeks  The Nikkei may experience a flash crash that has a better than even probability of also triggering the Head   Shoulders formation in that interval

The US dollar declined through its weekly short term support at 98 09 while also signaling a continuation of the decline  The Cycles Model calls for a pullback that may decline to trendline support near 92 00  The Cycles Model calls for a Master Cycle low by mid December  so this decline may be rather fast  Speculators may be caught the wrong way in their positons  causing a panic among the longs as this decline has the potential of wiping out all 2015 gains in the dollar long position  There is a lot of potential fuel to make this happen

NYSE WNS   Tap Potential Earnings Beats with 5 Top Stock PicksIt is not surprising that before an earnings season  every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectation  This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high quality in nature Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company Meanwhile  after much brainstorming and analysis of companies  financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  They in fact club their insights and a company s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher How to Find Stocks That Can Beat Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors  dream but not an easy job  One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release For the rest of this Screen of

379639,NWSA,FOMC Minutes  Pretty Much What We Thought,opinion,Price action on Wednesday was extremely lacklustre ahead of FOMC minutes that were scheduled to be released later in the day  Stronger than expected French industrial production data during the morning session prompted further support for the single currency  rallying to 1 3122 against the dollar and more notably above 130 00 to the yen  Poor Spanish and Italian industrial production data released shortly afterwards did little to reverse the trend  simply providing a retracement towards 1 3100  with this key level then acting as a magnet  In what should have been a slow morning in the run up to the key news from America    the FOMC minutes    were  accidently leaked   In short  we were going to highlight that the previous FOMC meeting was based on last month s seemingly mounting American economic recovery  which in turn would possibly provide some positive insight from the Fed and with it some support for the dollar Accidental DistributionHowever  this event has been brought forward with the minutes inadvertently being distributed to Congressional staffers and lobbyists hours ahead of schedule  The minutes contain what we had pretty much expected  the Federal Reserve during its March meeting discussed the possibility of slowing down its asset purchasing program possibly as early as the third quarter of this year  something we have forecast in our weekly recommendation service since January  However  the minutes continue by stating that this is on the basis that an ongoing improvement in the jobs sector materialises over the coming months  EUR USD dropped quite swiftly to 1 3067  however last Friday s horrible jobs data has come back to spoil the dollar party once again  As we mentioned above  the March FOMC meeting was based on how the economic recovery looked last month  which at the time showed growing momentum in employment  Last week s nonfarm payrolls data has almost made these latest job sector specific FOMC minutes redundant  highlighted by the fact that EUR USD has held steady around 1 3080 as market participants digest the news Going forward  there are two points that should be taken into account  First  non specific jobs data will become less of a focus over the coming months and jobs specific data will become more intensive All is not lost though for those bullish on the American economy and slightly worried of the dominant influence of employment data on monetary policy  We recommended a few months ago that the Fed would likely turn more attention to the impressive economic recovery as a respite from what then was a slow to stagnant jobs sector  This indeed became the point in hand  and the most recent minutes could be translated as simply emphasising jobs data at a time they d showed a vast improvement before the policy meeting was held  Monetary policy potential going forward could be considered realistically unchanged  considering the unemployment rate actually fell to 7 6  in March  which has been the indicator the Fed has publicly highlighted as its guideline in the months gone past  There should be little cause to change your mind on a reduction in QE purely for that reason ,2013-04-10,Andrew Dovey,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fomc-minutes:-pretty-much-what-we-thought-162458,162458

319613,TGT,3 Positive Opportunities  Consumer Defensives And Cyclical Stocks,opinion,"Consumer Defensive are stocks that deal with staples  As the name suggests  they provide a cushion against market volatility  pay good periodic dividends  and are less susceptible to market pullbacks  In times where the economic policies and trade decisions of the Trump administration scare the markets  not only locally but internationally  keeping consumer defensive stocks in your basket can be a good option as they provide diversification to the portfolio 
Going through our database and filters  we found 30 such stocks listed on S P 500  but we choose to write about two  I take the liberty to jump to another sector  Consumer Cyclical  because the third stock that I have chosen to write about looked equally promising 
Cyclicals follow a different set of rules  They rely heavily on the state of economy and business cycle  and include industries such as automotive  housing  entertainment  and retail  These can further be divided into durables and non durables  Given the expected healthy state of the US economy so far  and the not so bad development of the index in general  we can include one stock from consumer cyclicals

Walmart Inc  is inside a rising trend channel in short  medium and long term charts  Recently the stock broke out from a large rectangle formation that stretches back more than eighteen months  The price has also moved beyond the resistance of 105 and further rise to 131 or more is signaled 
There is now support around 105 and 99 dollars  However  in the longer term chart  the stock is nearing its earlier resistance of 110 dollars  This may pose some hindrance  but a close above that level will take the price into new territory and would signal further rise in price

Investtech s outlook  one to six months   Positive
Target Corp   NYSE TGT   Close  87 85

381411,BIDU,Exclusive  Baidu  JD com to join others investing  12 billion in state owned China Unicom   sources,news,"By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG  Reuters    Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  and JD com will join other big Chinese technology firms to jointly invest about  12 billion in the Shanghai listed unit of China Unicom  the weakest of three big state owned telecoms firms  two people with direct knowledge of the matter said 
The move is part of the Chinese government s drive to rejuvenate state behemoths with private capital  Beijing added China Unicom last year to a first batch of state owned enterprises to see mixed ownership reform 
China Unicom  formally known as China United Network Communications Group Co Ltd  is one of the world s largest mobile carriers by user numbers  but its recent earnings have struggled in a fiercely competitive market 
The carrier is widely seen as over staffed  inefficient and slow to develop key technologies  It already lags state owned China Mobile and China Telecom  and private firms have moved ahead in developing cloud and big data services  and mobile software 
Reuters reported last month that  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holdings and Tencent Holdings would be among new investors putting a total of about  10 billion into China United Network Communications Ltd  China Unicom s Shanghai listed unit 
That total is likely to rise to about 80 billion yuan   11 8 billion   with Baidu  China s biggest internet search provider  investing about 10 billion yuan   1 48 billion   and JD com  the country s second largest e commerce company  putting in about 5 billion yuan  one of the people said 
The China Unicom unit is likely to raise 15 billion yuan from Tencent and 7 billion yuan from Alibaba  while China Life Investment Holding Co Ltd would be the biggest new investor  with a 20 billion yuan commitment  that person added 
Overall  it would be the largest capital raising in the Asia Pacific region since insurer AIA Group s 2010 initial public offering  according to Thomson Reuters data 
The majority of the capital would be raised through new share issues  while China Unicom would also sell part of its stake in the Shanghai unit  the two people said 
Both sources declined to be identified as the talks are not public 
Baidu and JD com declined to comment  and China Unicom  Alibaba and Tencent didn t respond to Reuters requests for comment  China Life Investment Holding could not immediately be reached for comment 
China s State owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission  SASAC   which oversees state enterprises  also did not respond to requests for comment 
5G PUSH
After the share sale  China Unicom s stake in the Shanghai listed business would fall to just above 40 percent  from 63 percent currently  one of the sources said  and top investors  including China Life Investment and Tencent  would likely have seats on the firm s board to engage in its operations and improve its management 
Both sources said teaming up with China s big tech companies  particularly Tencent and Alibaba  would help revive China Unicom by lowering the cost of attracting new users and shifting its focus from traditional telecoms services to digital information services 
The share sale also comes at a time when Beijing is pushing to build the world s largest fifth generation  5G  mobile network   bringing a significant speed upgrade from today s 4G network 
China s 5G market could be worth 1 1 trillion yuan  or 3 2 percent of GDP  by 2025  according to a recent research paper from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology 
The capital raising would give China Unicom the firepower to boost its spending on 5G 
Share trading in China Unicom s Shanghai listed unit has been halted since it said in early April it would be part of the government s mixed ownership pilot  It gave no further details at that time  Prior to that suspension  the unit s market value topped  23 billion 
A week ago  the unit said it was waiting for regulatory approvals over details of the mixed ownership plans  and trading in its shares would remain suspended for another month 

The sources said the share sale plan is likely to be finalized by late August ",2017-07-21,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-baidu,-jd.com-to-join-others-investing-$12-billion-in-state-owned-china-unicom---sources-508349",508349
440794,WFC,Are Investor Fears Over EM Contagion Justified ,opinion,"The market s  fear  index is flipping out 
Trading volumes in front month VIX futures hit a record high last week  in terms of the number of contracts traded 
Anomaly  Hardly 
It turns out that this surge in weekly trading volume caps off the VIX s largest monthly trading volume  too 
In other words  fears have been building for weeks 
So what s got investors so freaked out  And is it justified  Let s take a closer look 
Call it a Contagion
After rallying nearly 30  last year  U S  stocks got off to a downright nasty start to 2014  dropping 3 6  in January alone 
Yet there was nothing overwhelmingly negative to spark such a precipitous selloff   at least in the United States  All of the trouble has been brewing overseas  particularly in emerging markets 
As the Financial Times  John Authers puts it  we ve experienced  ugly political eruptions  in Argentina  Ukraine and Turkey 
On the financial front  the world s fastest growing and largest emerging market  China  isn t growing that fast anymore   The latest GDP growth figures checked in at a 14 year low of 7 7    At the same time  the country is pulling out all the stops to avoid a  15 trillion shadow banking crisis 
Add it all up  and as much as pundits tried to tell us years ago that emerging markets were  decoupled  from developed markets  it s just not true 
Like I wrote before   Globalization   an undeniable  decades  old  economic force   created one quantum entanglement   So what happens in emerging markets doesn t stay in emerging markets 
And now we re witnessing the negative consequences of this reality 
With that in mind  here are three frightening statistics that underscore the potential severity of a slowdown in emerging markets 
Frightening Emerging Markets Stat  1  Say  Hello  to the New Majority
Years ago  we could easily dismiss a downturn in emerging markets  Why  Because developing countries accounted for a minority of global GDP 
Fast forward to today  though  and we can t be so cavalier 
According to Wells Fargo s Global Economist  Jay Bryson  developing countries accounted for 49 6  of global GDP at the end of 2012 
 Although 2013 data isn t available yet  it s safe to assume that the trend has continued  pushing developing countries  contribution squarely above 50  
Simply put  what happens in emerging markets significantly impacts the world 
Frightening Emerging Markets Stat  2  A Bigger and Bigger Customer
When most people think of emerging markets  they think of cheap manufactured goods  Get rid of that stereotype 
Developing economies are increasingly consumption driven  And guess what  Developed economies are the ones supplying their needs 
Statistically speaking  35  of exports from developed economies now go to developing economies  That s up from just 20  in 2000 
If developing country  customers  cut back  developed countries can t help but be impacted 
Frightening Emerging Markets Stat  3  Addicted to Debt
The U S  government isn t the only one that can rack up trillion dollar liabilities 
Alan Ruskin of Deutsche Bank points out that developing country liabilities now rest at  8 trillion   up nine fold from 1997 
To help put that in perspective  consider that global portfolio liabilities stood at about  5 7 trillion in 1997  So we re talking about the potential for a far reaching financial crisis  should emerging economies start defaulting on their liabilities 
Bottom line  Unlike any other time in history  the economic importance of developing countries has reached a critical level  whereby the developed world must pay attention  So investors  fears over an emerging markets contagion are completely justified 
By no means am I suggesting that you should join in the panic  Right now  I just want to make sure you re aware of the legitimate threat ",2014-02-11,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-investor-fears-over-em-contagion-justified-202144,202144
342449,VRTX,5 Toxic Stocks To Discard Or Play Short For Profit,opinion,One of the important keys to successful investing is the proper identification of overpriced stocks and correctly priced ones  However  in reality  the overpriced toxic stocks and the fairly priced stocks are intermingled in the market place in such a way that it becomes extremely difficult to distinguish them  Investors who can figure out the toxic stocks and abandon them at the right time are likely to gain Generally  toxic stocks are susceptible to external shocks and are loaded with huge debts  Also  sometimes  the price of the toxic stocks is unjustifiably inflated  The irrationally high price of the toxic stocks is only temporary as the intrinsic value of these stocks is lower than the current bloated price The inflated price of the toxic stocks can be due to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental drawback  If you own such stocks for a very long period of time  you are sure to see huge erosion in your wealth On the other hand  if you can pinpoint the toxic stocks accurately  you may gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets So  identifying toxic stocks and throwing them away at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses or make profits by short selling them Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks Most recent Debt Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average  High debt equity ratio implies high leverage  High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount P E using 12 month forward EPS estimate greater than 50  A very high forward P E implies that a stock is highly overvalued   Change in F  1  and F  2  Estimate  12 Weeks  less than  5  Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts  pessimism Zacks Rank more than or equal to  3  Hold   We have not considered Buy rated stocks that generally outperform the market Here are five of the 19 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen Etsy  Inc    NASDAQ ETSY   is a Brooklyn  NY based Internet services company  It operates a marketplace to make  sell and buy goods online and offline worldwide  Over the last 30 days  its quarter estimates widened from a loss of a penny per share to a loss of 2 cents  The company has a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  Live Nation Entertainment  Inc    NYSE LYV   is a Beverly Hills  CA based live entertainment company  Over the past 30 days  its second quarter 2017 estimates remained unchanged at 17 cents a share  The stock currently has a Zacks Rank  3 Salesforce com  inc    NYSE CRM   is a San Francisco  CA based computer software industry firm  Over the past one month period  its second quarter earnings estimate has declined 18 2  to 9 cents a share  Currently  the company carries a Zacks Rank  3 Boston  MA based  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   NASDAQ VRTX   is a biotechnology company  Over the past one month period  current quarter estimates remained unchanged at 5 cents per share  The stock currently has a Zacks Rank  3 NeoGenomics  Inc    NASDAQ NEO   is a Fort Myers  FL based company belonging to the biomedical and genetics industry  Over the past one month period  current quarter estimates remained unchanged at 2 cents per share  The stock currently has a Zacks Rank  3 Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test  It can all be done with the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting software The Research Wizard is a great place to begin  It s easy to use  Everything is in plain language  And it s very intuitive  Start your Research Wizard trial today  And the next time you read an economic report  open up the Research Wizard  plug your finds in  and see what gems come out  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material  An affiliated investment advisory firm may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material Disclosure  Performance information for Zacks  portfolios and strategies are available at   Zacks Restaurant Recommendations  In addition to dining at these special places  you can feast on their stock shares  A Zacks Special Report spotlights 5 recent IPOs to watch plus 2 stocks that offer immediate promise in a booming sector ,2017-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-toxic-stocks-to-discard-or-play-short-for-profit-200196038,200196038

Volatility in oil prices has jumped this month as crude is buffeted by the specter of a full blown trade war on the demand side  while a combustible Middle East and production disruptions from Norway to Nigeria throw the supply outlook into doubt  U S  drilling activity and a pending decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies on whether output curbs will be extended beyond June are taking a back seat to the various crises

The latest meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   held on Friday in Vienna  Austria  did not have as much impact on markets as its meeting of last November  At that time  prices for crude fell 20  over the following two weeks  In contrast  market prices had risen slightly by the end of the day on Friday 


OPEC announced that it will not be changing its production quotas  keeping them at 30 million barrels per day  The latest figures show that member countries have been producing 31 5 million barrels per day  so they are falling short of full compliance  Production by cartel members has reached its highest level in close to three years 


OPEC has decided not to give up any market share to non OPEC countries  this was also the message it delivered after its last meeting  Given how energy markets responded on Friday  we can safely assume that prices were already fully reflecting OPEC s position 


On Friday Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  reported that there were 868 active drilling rigs in the U S  Once again  this is the lowest level seen in several years  It was slightly below the low of 2009  when the rig count fell to 876 


We are still recommending that clients take advantage of market volatility to leave orders at just a few cents below current prices  The price volatility on Thursday allowed several of our clients to lock in supplies at attractive prices  Have a good week

314915,INTC,Intel Corp  Attractive Opportunity  Bargain Valutation,opinion,Intel Corp  INTC  is trading at one of the lowest price earnings ratios in its history  Apparently the market must feel that PCs are dead  and therefore  so is Intel  However  we believe most of the weakness in PCs can be attributed to buyers holding back as they await the release of Windows 8  Consequently  we believe that Intel represents an extremely attractive opportunity to buy this technology bellwether at a bargain valuation while simultaneously earning a generous and growing dividend yield  Earnings Determine Market Price  The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings   Earnings   Price Correlated Fundamentals at a Glance A quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs  on Intel Corp paints a vivid picture of significant undervaluation based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 15 4  and a current PE of 9 9  Clearly  Intel s earnings growth rate has accelerated since the great recession of 2008  However  we believe the expected weakness for 2012 is as we previously stated  mostly attributed to delayed purchases pending Windows 8  Currently  analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to average about 10  a year starting in 2014 and beyond  However  concerns for 2013 are still low  Nevertheless  even if 2013 generates the muted growth rate expected  we would argue that Intel with a 4  dividend yield is worth at least 15 times earnings  the orange line on the graphic below   Intel Corp  Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal PE Since 2009 For a more comprehensive look at a bullish case for the long term opportunity in front on Intel  we direct you to the following excellent article entitled  by Ashraf Eassa  Moreover  in order to conduct your own research and get a clearer perspective on Intel s valuation  click on the picture below that links you to a fully functioning sample F A S T  Graphs  on Intel and research this high quality dividend growth stock deeper and faster Performance Table Intel CorpThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 12 4  capital appreciation  green circle   long term shareholders of Intel Corp   assuming an initial investment of  1 000  would have received an additional  178 54 in dividends that increased their total return from 12 4  to 15 7  per annum versus 13 9  in the S P 500 The following graph plots the historical PE ratio  the dark blue line  in conjunction with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 2009 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Intel Corp is 2 09 which is historically low  Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 23 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Intel Corp s long term earnings growth at 10   orange circle   Intel Corp has low long term debt at 13  of capital  Intel Corp is currently trading at a P E of 9 9  which is below the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Intel Corp s True Worth  valuation would be  50 73 at the end of 2018  brown circle on EYE Chart   which would be a 19 4  annual rate of return from the current price  yellow highlighting  Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Intel Corp to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds  illustrates that Intel Corp s expected earnings would be 9 2  purple circle  times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component Summary   ConclusionsThis report presented essential  fundamentals at a glance  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future

404206,ADP,GBP USD To Target  1 24 Post NFP ,opinion,"With the House of Lords expected to approve the anti hard Brexit bill today  rumours of a late October election swirling and NFP report pending cable traders have plenty to be watching on Friday 
Today at 13 30 BST the U S  nonfarm payroll figures will be released  Expectations are for 160 000 jobs to have been created in August  Given the rebound in the dollar in the previous session investors could be hoping for a slightly stronger figure today 
And they could be right  There are several data points which indicate that the number of jobs created in August will surprise to the upside 
1  ADP private payrolls surprised to the upside with the largest increase in private sector jobs in 4 months
2  Jobless claims remained low with no signs of rising layoffs
However  there has also been a slew of data which indicates that the NFP could actually disappoint   
1  Whilst U S  non manufacturing print impressed  the employment component of the report was a cause for concern  dropping to the lowest level in 2 years  Given the dominance of the service sector in the U S  economy  there is a strong correlation between the ISM non manufacturing employment component and the NFP  This is arguably a stronger lead indicator than the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  private payrolls print 
2  The manufacturing sector is experiencing a slump  This is being reflected in employment numbers for the sector which have fallen to a three year low  Whilst this sector accounts for a much smaller area off the economy than services  it adds to the weaker jobs picture 
3  Finally  the University of Michigan confidence indicator experienced the biggest 1 month drop since 2012  Erosion of consumer confidence due to the ongoing U S    Sino trade dispute is now well underway  which  whilst there is no trade war solution in sight  doesn t bode well for the U S  economy or the labour market 
A print below 150k could well be in the pipeline and will disappoint  A weak figure could stoke slowdown and recession fears in the U S  economy  boosting expectations of further intervention from the Fed  Under this scenario we expect the dollar to fall 
GBPUSD levels to watch 





After three days of Brexit inspired gains GBPUSD has been moving lower in early trade on Friday  A weak US NFP report could see the pair push through resistance at  1 2355 and target  1 24  A stronger than forecast NFP could send GBPUSD lower  testing resistance at  1 2245 prior to  1 2210 ",2019-09-06,Fiona Cincotta,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gbpusd-to-target-124-post-nfp-200462251,200462251
335650,CAKE,Stocks Advance Ahead of Fed s Policy Stance,opinion,"U S  stocks traded higher as technology issues recovered from a two session slide to lead the advance  though gains may have been limited ahead of tomorrow s Fed monetary policy decision  with a rate hike widely anticipated  Treasuries were mixed but mostly flat despite a hotter than expected wholesale price inflation report  The U S  dollar dipped  gold saw minor gains and crude oil prices were also higher 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  increased 93 points  0 4   to 21 328  the S P 500 Index gained 11 points  0 5   to 2 440  and the NASDAQ Composite jumped 45 points  0 7   to 6 220  In moderately heavy volume  825 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 2 1 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ  WTI crude oil increased  0 38 to  46 46 per barrel and wholesale gasoline  was  0 01 higher at  1 50 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg gold spot price increased  0 74 to  1 266 92 per ounce  and the dollar index  a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies  was 0 1  lower at 97 00 
Dow member Merck   Co  Inc   NYSE MRK  63  announced that it has paused the enrollment in two trials of its treatment for blood cancer  multiple myeloma  as it looks into reports of deaths for patients using the drug  MRK traded lower 
The Cheesecake Factory  NASDAQ CAKE  53  fell sharply after the restaurant reported that it expects Q2 same store sales to decline 1 0  year over year  y y   versus the FactSet expectation of a 1 7  gain  The company noted heightened volatility in week to week sales trends  indicative of uncertainty on the part of many consumers  as well as pockets of softness  notably in the East and Midwest 
The technology sector recovered somewhat from a rollover that led a two day slip in the equity markets from record high territory  Concerns have flared up about the rally in the group that has led the stock market run  The tech run likely won t go on forever nothing does but we don t see the unabashed enthusiasm for the group that would make us more concerned  and valuations aren t extended to the point that we believe investors should start to worry  That doesn t mean investors who have developed too large a position in tech relative to their risk tolerances shouldn t rebalance and take some profits  But we continue to see positive developments and believe the run in the tech sector still has further to go 
Producer price inflation mostly tops forecasts  small business optimism holds steady
The Producer Price Index  PPI  showed prices at the wholesale level in May were flat month over month  m m   matching the Bloomberg expectation and compared to April s unrevised 0 5  gain  The core rate  which excludes food and energy  was up 0 3   versus forecasts of a 0 1  advance and April s unrevised 0 4  increase  Y Y  the headline rate was 2 4  higher  above projections of a 2 3  increase  and the core PPI increased 2 1  last month  topping estimates of a 1 9  gain  In April  producer prices were 2 5  higher and up 1 9  for the headline and core rates  respectively 
The National Federation of Independent Business  NFIB  Small Business Optimism Index for May remained at April s unrevised 104 5 level  matching expectations 
Treasuries were mixed and little changed  with the yield on the 2 Year note increasing 1 basis point  bp  to 1 36   while the yields on the 10 Year note and the 30 Year bond decreased 1 bp to 2 21  and 2 86   respectively 
Recently  bond yields have rebounded somewhat from a bout of pressure that stemmed from heightened political uncertainty on both sides of the Atlantic  as well as some mixed economic data  Also  the two day Federal Open Market Committee s  FOMC  monetary policy meeting  which began today  is expected to yield a 25 bp increase to the target federal funds rate  However  the markets have grappled with the timing and frequency of further rate hikes and the likelihood that the Central Bank will begin the process of shrinking its huge balance sheet later this year 
Tomorrow s statement accompanying the decision  as well as updated economic projections and subsequent press conference by Chairwoman Janet Yellen  are poised to garner heavy scrutiny 
Before the FOMC concludes its meeting tomorrow  we will get some key May economic reports  with the Consumer Price Index expected to show core inflation was just shy of the Fed s target of 2 0  y y  along with retail sales  projected to continue to nudge higher m m  Weekly MBA mortgage applications will also be released  as well as April business inventories 
Modest growth  low inflation and a cautious Fed are combining to make things  just right  for investors  Additionally  the apparent improving global trade trend could help contribute to further stock market gains and support large cap outperformance  But the risk of a pullback and or sharp acceleration in volatility is elevated courtesy of both domestic and world political uncertainty  and the potential of a Fed misstep 
Europe mostly higher and Asia stabilizes as tech stocks rebound European equities finished mostly higher  with the technology sector rebounding from yesterday s drop  while the markets looked ahead to tomorrow s monetary policy decision in the U S   as well as decisions out of the U K   Switzerland and Japan this week  The U K  remained in focus amid heightened political uncertainty as Prime Minister May deals with the fallout from last week s surprising election that resulted in a hung parliament  The election fostered uncertainty regarding the timing of Brexit negotiations and whether they will yield hard or softer exit terms 
Also  U K  consumer price inflation came in hotter than expected  sending the British pound higher versus the U S  dollar to hamstring U K  stocks  Bond yields in the nation are getting a boost from the data  In other economic news  German investor confidence came in mixed  with the current conditions component unexpectedly improving  while the outlook portion surprisingly declined  The euro was little changed versus the greenback and bond yields in the region were mixed 
Stocks in Asia finished mixed to mostly higher on the heels of yesterday s decline that came courtesy of the rollover in the U S  technology sector from a recent rally  while the markets look to monetary policy decisions out of the U S   Japan and the U K  this week  Japanese equities dipped with the yen paring some of yesterday s gains on increased global uncertainties and a disappointing read on the nation s capital spending 
Indian stocks finished flat  as the markets pause near record highs and digest data showing the nation s consumer price inflation was cooler than expected  though industrial production topped forecasts  Shares trading in mainland China and Hong Kong advanced  while South Korean listings also moved to the upside  with technology issues showing some signs of stabilization in the region from the flare up in volatility yesterday  Australian securities returned to action from yesterday s holiday in positive fashion  rallying amid a recovery in the financial sector

345244,CME,PRECIOUS Gold recovers from bin Laden news  silver tumbles,news,"  Gold trimmed losses  bullish trend intact
   Silver slides by more than 10 pct  most since October 2008
   Technical selling in thin condition compounds losses

  Recasts  adds details and quotes 	
 By Nick Trevethan and Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE  May 2  Reuters    Silver prices tumbled on
Monday  making their biggest loss since late 2008  while gold
trimmed losses triggered by news that al Qaeda leader Osama bin
Laden was killed in a U S  led operation in Pakistan 	
 Silver   hit by a recovery in the dollar  increased
futures trading margins and a technical overhang after a 170
percent rally over the last 12 months  fell as much as 10
percent to  43 04 an ounce  its lowest in nearly two weeks 
before recovering to  44 92 	
 COMEX silver futures  tumbled 13 percent to  42 20
earlier in holiday thinned trade  and trimmed losses to  44 96 	
  Silver is an accident waiting to happen  and it seems like
it has incurred  bumper  damage today   said Citigroup analyst
David Thurtell  	
 Gold initially fell more than  5  as bin Laden s death was
seen to take off some of its safe haven appeal  but traders
expected gold s bullish trend to remain intact  against the
backdrop of the macroeconomic and political environment 	
  I m not too concerned about gold at the moment   said
Darren Heathcote  head of trading at Investec Australia  adding
that the continuously weakening dollar and lofty oil prices
would remain supportive of bullion 	
 Spot gold fell over  5 to an intra day low of
 1 540 39  after hitting a record of  1 575 79 earlier  It was
trading at  1 558 55 an ounce by 0638 GMT  down 0 3 percent from
the previous close 	
 COMEX gold futures  reversed early losses to edge up
0 2 percent to  1 559 20 
 
 
 
 GOLD S APPEAL SEEN UNDIMMED 	
 Concerns that extremist groups might launch reprisal attacks
over the death of bin Laden may brighten gold s safe haven
appeal 	
  The threat from terrorism is not over  Others will fill the
gap he has left  I suspect that his death will trigger a
retaliatory attack in the short term   said Thurtell   I think
gold s status as a safe haven is intact  	
 Markets across large parts of Asia and much of Europe were
closed for May Day and Labour day holidays  reducing the number
of market participants and making for volatile trade 	
 Speculators scaled back their bullish bets in COMEX silver
futures and options to the lowest level since early February 
regulator data showed on Friday   ID nN29175149 	
 The CME Group Inc said on Thursday it would raise
maintenance margins for COMEX silver futures by 13 2 percent to
 10 750 per contract from  9 500 effective Friday  April 29 	
 Some traders put down silver s spectacular fall to an
unwinding of a short gold silver ratio position  compounded by
automated stop loss orders 	
 The gold silver ratio  used to measure the number of silver
ounces needed to buy an ounce of gold  rebounded to about 35
from below 32  its lowest level since the early 1980s  This
compares with an average ratio of 64 in the past 29 years 	
  There is nothing from a fundamental perspective to cause a
fall this large  Silver has been the most rapidly appreciating
of the metals in the past months and if there was one that
looked a bit frothy it was silver   said Ben Westmore 
commodities economist at National Australia Bank 	
  This is mostly technical  We expect silver to be in
relatively close step with gold and while both have risen
strongly  silver may have moved a bit too far ahead  	
 But in spite of the falls  traders said it was too soon to
close the book on silver s astounding rally over the past 12
months 	
  Although that was a brutal wash out of some length  silver
is now back into the original bullish trend channel  so while
 41 holds  the trend is still intact   one trader said 	
 Among other precious metals with large scale industrial
applications  platinum fell 1 percent and palladium
 dropped 1 2 percent 	
 China s manufacturing growth slowed in April  a survey
showed on Sunday  suggesting that the government s tightening
efforts have weighed on the world s second largest economy more
heavily than expected   ID nL3E7G100E 	
 The official purchasing managers  index for China fell to
52 9 in April from 53 4 in March  well shy of market forecasts
for an increase to 54 0

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Low PEG Stocks Value Investors Will Love 

Investment has never been as daring a task as it is today  with the world stock market shaken by multiple factors   economic or otherwise  So  the biggest challenge is how to keep our portfolio safe and lucrative 

If we have to go by Warren Buffet s formula  it is value investing that can offer the succor we need during tough times  Value investing has especially proven its worth during times of market crash or global downturn 

However  failing to choose the right value strategy  which gives investors a precise idea about the intrinsic value of a stock  may lead to traps  In other words  it could lead to a situation when these picks start to underperform  as those temporary problems which once drove the share price down may turn out to be endemic  To avoid such value traps  Buffet has advised investors to keep a focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock  And here comes the significance of an out in the cold value investing metric  the PEG ratio 

The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings   Earnings Growth Rate

A lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors 

While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps finding the intrinsic value of a stock 

There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term 

Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration 

Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy 

PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median

P E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median

Zacks Rank of 1 or 2   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have a proven history of success 

Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion   This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 20 000   A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5    Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness 

Value Score of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

Here are 5 of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening 

AngloGold Ashanti Ltd        This gold mining and exploration company currently carries a Zacks Rank  1 and a Value Style Score  B   The company also has an impressive expected five year growth rate of 27 6  

Companhia de Saneamento Basico do Estado de Sao Paulo       This popular name in the field of basic and environmental sanitation services in Sao Paolo currently holds a Zacks Rank  1 and a Value Style score  A   The company registered an earnings surprise of 20  in its last reported quarter 

Nucor Corporation       NUE is a steel and steel products manufacturer in the U S  This Zacks Rank  2 and Value Style Score  B  company also has an impressive expected five year growth rate of 27 6  

Seagate Technology plc       This worldwide provider of electronic data storage products can be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank  2 and Value Style Score  A

254823,CMG,Chicken growers set to pay price for no antibiotic McNugget,news,"By P J  Huffstutter and Lisa Baertlein
CHICAGO LOS ANGELES  Reuters    McDonald s Corp  NYSE MCD  s decision last week to phase out human antibiotics from its U S  chicken supply will add to costs of production in a tight margin business that are likely to be borne mostly by poultry companies 
McDonald s  whose top chicken suppliers include giant  Tyson Foods  Inc  NYSE TSN   has given its producers two years to eradicate all antibiotics used on humans from barns and hatcheries  It s going to be expensive and may take longer than planned  switching to antibiotic free chickens could increase on farm costs by up to 3 percent  Perdue Farms  a supplier with about a third the volume of Tyson  told Reuters it s taken more than a decade and millions of dollars to make such a change 
McDonald s will use its purchasing muscle as the world s largest restaurant chain to avoid passing extra costs on to customers  increasingly lower income as more affluent diners prefer competitors like  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc   NYSE CMG   said analysts including Morningstar s R J  Hottovy 
Marion Gross  McDonald s senior vice president of North America supply chain management  declined to say how much the company s costs for chicken could rise  Rather  she told Reuters  the project is  an investment  to meet customer demand 
While veterinary use of antibiotics is legal  controversy has grown over routine feeding of antibiotics that are important to humans to otherwise healthy chicken  cattle and pigs in a bid to stave off disease and help the animals grow more quickly 
The risk is that overuse could spur the creation of so called superbugs that develop cross resistance to antibiotics used to treat humans  Reuters found last year that major U S  poultry firms were administering antibiotics to their flocks on the farm far more pervasively than regulators realized 
The poultry industry maintains there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people  However  more restaurants and retailers are heeding the concerns of consumers  straining meat supplies 
Sandwich chain Chick fil A in 2014 gave its producers five years to meet its commitment to go antibiotic free for chicken  Perdue is a major supplier to Chick fil A 
Costco Wholesale Corp  NASDAQ COST    the nation s third largest retailer that annually sells 80 million rotisserie chickens  told Reuters Thursday it has a  large  appetite for chicken free of these medically important antibiotics 
The company is aware of the supply difficulties and won t commit to a timeline  said Craig Wilson  vice president of food safety for Costco 
WHO PAYS THE PRICE 
Some of the extra costs of cutting out antibiotics could be borne by franchisees  which could cut labor hours  waste and utility costs to offset higher meat prices 
But most analysts expect McDonald s to push the costs back onto its suppliers  who may not have the market power to resist  The top four U S  chicken processors control about 53 percent of the domestic market  according to the National Chicken Council 
McDonald s  carries a lot of clout with suppliers   and some of them are dependent on the chain for survival  Hottovy said 
Tyson and Keystone Foods  part of Brazil based Marfrig Global Foods SA  both told Reuters they have significantly reduced medically important antibiotic use in their flocks and are positioned to meet McDonald s and other customers  needs  However  neither company would answer specific questions about how such drugs are used on farm and in hatcheries 
SLOW CHANGES
Perdue  the fourth largest domestic chicken producer  began removing antibiotics used for growth promotion in 2002 amid consumer questions about what was being put into the animal feed  said Bruce Stewart Brown  senior vice president of food safety  quality and live operations 
Now more than 95 percent of the chickens it produces are raised without antibiotics approved for human use  and more than half are raised with no antibiotics of any kind  according to the company 
The transition led to unexpectedly high bird mortality rates  a need for more chicken houses and spending at least  4 million more a year on vaccines than rivals who haven t made the switch  among other things  Birds raised without antibiotics also generally take three to nine days longer to reach their market weight  Stewart Brown told Reuters    or as much as 20 percent longer than conventionally raised birds 
McDonald s two year deadline is  a really fast timeframe to do it right and be predictable to your customers and your supply   Stewart Brown said 
Birds raised on farms without antibiotics take longer to reach optimal slaughter weight  resulting in higher feed costs and death rates  forcing companies to ramp up with more eggs at the hatcheries  said Tom Elam of FarmEcon  an agricultural consulting company 

 The ones that aren t quite as good with keeping up with their biosecurity  it s going to cause some issues   Elam said   This change is not free  ",2015-03-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chicken-growers-set-to-pay-price-for-no-antibiotic-mcnugget-331366,331366
242064,MU,Data Storage Company Trading At A Discount,opinion,"The ongoing search for yield has had many powerful effects on the market  including driving the prices of large  stable companies skyward 
As a result  the high yielding large cap is on the verge of extinction these days 
Still  I decided to dig through the ones that remain  there aren t many   and I found one stalwart  that boasts a double digit total yield right now 
Price Gouged
After scouring a list of large cap stocks with dividend yields of at least 3 75   then comparing their valuation metrics  Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX   an American data storage company incorporated in Dublin  Ireland  stood out from the pack 
The firm  which was a critical player in the personal computer revolution  primarily manufactures hard disk drives  HDD  for computers and datacenters 
Today  though  Seagate s main product has become ancient technology  at least in computer terms   and that has weighed heavily on its share price  Just take a look at STX s price year to date 

That s a precipitous decline 
Yet  the stock s free fall has actually made it attractively valued  In fact  the stock has lots to offer investors at the moment 
Cheap  Stable Income
First  the valuation  It s hard to ignore that STX is cheap  and that itself is unique in today s market  As of this writing  the stock is trading below its 50 day moving average of  56 and even further below its 200 day moving average of  60 
For further proof  check out this chart comparing STX s valuation to its own 10 year averages  as well as the rest of the computer hardware companies in the S P 500 

As you can see  it s pretty much right in line with its 10 year averages and is trading at a significant discount to comparable companies  Yet that s hardly the only upside that STX has right now 
Indeed  STX stock boasts a fantastic yield  That starts with a 4  dividend yield  which is exceptional for a large cap stock in this market 
Meanwhile  that dividend has been growing rapidly since it was reinstated in April of 2011  The most recent hike boosted the payout by over 25   and the dividend has grown over 200  in the last four years 
Of course  a solid  growing dividend means nothing if the company can t sustain that momentum 
Luckily  Seagate is a cash flow machine  It posted nearly  1 3 billion in free cash flow for the second quarter of 2015  and its dividend was covered more than four times over in the last 12 months  Going back further  the dividend has been covered at least three times over for five consecutive years 
On top of that  Seagate has been actively buying back shares for a number of years now  and that s led to an outstanding total yield  In the last fiscal year  STX bought back 9  of its shares  giving the stock just over 13  total yield 
All told  Seagate has bought back over 30  of its outstanding shares since 2010   and as long as the stock is trading below  60  management says it will continue repurchasing shares 
What Does the Future Hold 
I believe the 20  runoff in STX s share price since January is excessive for a number of reasons 
First  Seagate has been working to retool its product line  and its business is no longer tied solely to HDDs  It now produces the more modern solid state drives  SSD  that are also made by competitors such as SanDisk  NASDAQ SNDK  and Micron Technology  NASDAQ MU   Plus  Seagate has also adapted its enterprise storage business to include cloud based solutions 
And in the short term  Seagate s HDDs still offer numerous advantages over competing technology  First  they remain substantially cheaper than solid state drives  As of February  PC Magazine estimated that HDDs cost roughly  0 07 per gigabyte  while the price of SSDs is double that  at  0 14 per gigabyte  And secondly  HDDs   with at least 10 terabytes of storage for personal computers   have much greater storage capacity than SSDs  which top out around four terabytes 
If that s not enough  Seagate reported record storage shipments in its most recent quarter  up 17  year over year  And even though it saw revenue decline in the second quarter  management estimates that it would ve posted a 5  revenue increase were it not for currency volatility around the world 
Finally  Seagate has one other fairly unique advantage  Because of its incorporation in Dublin  it pays an effective 0  tax rate  Several companies have attempted this tax inversion recently  but Seagate is one of just 20 in the S P 500 that s already enjoying this tax friendly situation 
Bottom line  The recent drop in Seagate s share price presents an opportunity for investors who could use a high yielding  large cap stock in their portfolios  Without a doubt  STX shareholders will be richly rewarded for holding the stock

392239,AMZN,Retail Apocalypse And Gold,opinion,"Retail stores have been disappearing from the U S  economy in 2017  What does it mean for the gold market 
Writing about the retail apocalypse during Christmas time may be a bit odd  but the numbers do not lie  From January to September 2017  6 752 locations  excluding grocery stores and restaurants  were scheduled to close  It s more than twice compared to the 2016 total and very close to the all time high of 6 900 in a crisis 2008 
What are the reasons behind the closures of retail stores  It is hard to say  One thing is the dynamic growth of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and the development of e commerce  But another issue is the debt overload among retailers often from leveraged buyouts  Refinancing becomes more and more difficult with rising interest rates  It implies that the Fed s tightening   or the previous period of ultra low interest rates   has some negative effects  And rising costs of education  healthcare and housing left less money for retail shopping  Another factor is an over supply of malls 
What does it all mean for the gold market  Well  the decline in the number of retail stores may negatively hit the U S  economy  which should be positive for the yellow metal  However  the sky is not falling  Mall occupancy remains strong and a lot of stores are opening  It seems that the market is just evolving as there are important structural changes   apparel and electronic stores are hit  but not all stores  And healthy retailers will replace the bankrupts  Hence  it does not seem that the gold market will be significantly affected by the so called retail apocalypse  However  it is worth remembering that intense competition resulting from the presence of e commerce may lower inflation  Low inflation is negative for gold prices  unless it translates into a more   Stay tuned

309610,NFLX,Redstone weighs CBS Viacom merger with or without Moonves,news,"By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK  Reuters    As she seeks to combine CBS Corp  N CBS  and Viacom Inc  O VIAB  into a single company  media mogul Shari Redstone risks losing her most talented executive  whose leadership could be critical to ensuring the proposed merger succeeds  Such is the difficulty facing Redstone  Her longtime friend and business ally  powerful CBS Chief Executive Les Moonves  has emerged as one of the biggest obstacles to a potential CBS Viacom tie up  according to people familiar with the matter  Concerns are that his objections could either doom the transaction or that he might not lead the new entity  the people said   Moonves is chafing at Redstone s insistence on installing Viacom s CEO as his second in command and likely successor of a merged company  the people say  CBS and Viacom announced in February that they were exploring a potential deal and in recent weeks have begun negotiations  At stake is the future of Redstone s media empire  which is facing pressure to scale up at a time when competitors are gobbling rivals to stay relevant  Her family s company  National Amusements Inc  controls both CBS and Viacom  Redstone favors merging the two to gain size and leverage in negotiating better programming prices from traditional cable and satellite customers  and to better compete with emerging players such as Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   the people said  But she may have to decide if she is willing to do it without her top captain to steer the ship   Redstone wants Moonves to run the combined company  according to the people familiar with the situation  all of whom wished to remain anonymous because discussions are confidential  But she is contemplating moving forward without him at the helm if no agreement can be reached to keep him aboard  said one of the people close to the situation   With over 25 years at CBS and more than a decade as CEO  Moonves has proven adept at navigating a difficult media landscape  Under his leadership  CBS has been a top performer in its sector with some of the most popular shows on television  CBS stock is up over 116 percent on his watch  At 68  Moonves is an industry legend and still at the top of his game  Still  Redstone is concerned about succession planning  the people said  She wants 54 year old Bob Bakish  whom she chose two years ago to lead a turnaround at Viacom  to be president and chief operating officer of the combined company  Bakish would report to Moonves  with the expectation of succeeding him  the people said   Shari values Les  but we are now in a world of   What happens after Les    said one of the people close to the situation   Redstone  Moonves and Bakish declined to comment through representatives  Viacom declined to comment    The industry and the marketplace know Leslie Moonves  record and we think it speaks for itself   CBS said in a statement  Moonves  meanwhile  wants his longtime lieutenant  CBS Chief Operating Officer Joseph Ianniello  to take the No  2 spot at the combined company  according to people familiar with his thinking   The men have forged a successful working relationship that could prove key to melding two very different entities  Moonves and Viacom s Bakish  in contrast  have met just a handful of times  according to people familiar with the situation   Les is saying  I want to make this successful     but let me have my team    one of the people said  OLD HAND  NEW BLOOD Despite recent tensions  Redstone has long been close to Moonves  who was selected by her father  Sumner Redstone  to be CEO of CBS when it was spun off from Viacom in 2006  She and Moonves have gone to football games and movie premiers together  And she has said that Moonves was one of her staunchest supporters amid highly public legal battles  including a feud with Viacom s former CEO  Philippe Dauman  and clashes with former girlfriends of her elderly father seeking a share of his riches   I have a great relationship with Les   Redstone  63  told a Recode conference last year  Redstone has also taken a shine to Bakish since plucking him from Viacom s international division in 2016 and installing him as the firm s chief executive  As CEO  Bakish engineered a turnaround plan for the company s struggling movie studio and TV networks and boosted badly sagging staff morale  keeping Redstone in the loop through it all  people familiar with the situation said   That is a big change considering that Redstone for years was unwelcome at Viacom under former CEO Dauman  the people said  A bid by the Redstones to reassert control culminated in Dauman s departure in 2016   The media heiress is now a familiar face in the hallways of Viacom s New York offices  She has attended employee town halls and company events  including the relaunch of the MTV show  Total Request Live   Bakish and Redstone talk at least weekly  and he includes her in all major decisions  according to people familiar with the situation    He brought her in and solicits her thoughts  and in some ways that was the way to her heart   said one person close to Redstone and Viacom  Redstone believes Bakish should succeed Moonves because he has executed on his turnaround plan and has a vision for the combined company that he is excited about  the people familiar with the situation said   NOT A DONE DEAL There are other issues that could scuttle the merger   The special board committees that CBS and Viacom have formed to negotiate a deal currently disagree about how many CBS shares Viacom shareholders should receive   CBS has offered 0 55 of its shares for every Viacom Class B share  according to the sources  Viacom countered last week that it wanted 0 68 CBS shares for every Viacom Class B share  the sources said  What is clear is that Moonves is seen as a major asset to the combined company  Many analysts expect CBS  stock to take a hit if he is not part of any new leadership team  If the current standoff continues  Redstone may have to decide whether losing Moonves is worth going to the mat for Bakish  the up and comer  
 They are both stars   Redstone said of CBS and Viacom at the Recode conference last year   And I love them both  ",2018-04-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/redstone-weighs-cbsviacom-merger-with-or-without-moonves-1388613,1388613

330689,BLK,Japan s Benchmark Bond Yield Touches One Year High on BOJ Bets,news," Bloomberg     Japan s 10 year yield climbed to 0 1 percent  the highest in more than a year  as speculation that the central bank may discuss adjusting its ultra loose monetary policy next week continued to rattle the bond market 
The benchmark yield has more than doubled from last Friday as media reports suggested that Bank of Japan officials are debating ways to mitigate the side effects of its policy on lenders  The yield continued to rise even after the BOJ signaled its intention to cap the advance by offering to buy an unlimited amount of bonds on Monday  It didn t make such an offer on Thursday 
The speculation around BOJ s policy has roiled global markets this week  causing yield curves in Japan and other countries including the U S  and Australia to steepen as traders hedged against the possibility of the Asian nation s bond funds pivoting home  Any change to BOJ s policy would be the first since September 2016  when it began the yield curve control 
 The BOJ probably refrained from stepping in to conduct a fixed rate operation as the 10 year yield didn t go over 0 1 percent decisively   said Hidenori Suezawa  chief bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc   Volatility was lower today compared with Monday  The BOJ acted then as the yield had jumped sharply and abruptly  
The 10 year yield was up two basis points at 0 085 percent as of 4 05 p m  in Tokyo  It rose as much as 3 5 basis points earlier to 0 1 percent  the first time since July last year  according to data from the Japan Bond Trading Co  The yen was 0 2 percent higher to 110 71 against the dollar 
Testing BOJ
The yield pared its advance even as the BOJ refrained from conducting another fixed rate operation to try and tame markets  Monday was only the fifth time the central bank offered to buy an unlimited amount of bonds since the introduction of the YCC  Only one operation in February 2017 led to purchases 
Traders may be testing if the BOJ is indeed leaning toward allowing the 10 year yield to be more flexible  said Makoto Suzuki  senior bond strategist of Okasan Securities Group in Tokyo 
The driver for the yield gain on Thursday may have been a new Jiji report  The BOJ may raise the threshold for its fixed rate operations  while retaining its zero percent target  Jiji had said overnight  according to a Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  Securities Co  report 
At BOJ s July 30 31 review  officials will discuss ways to keep their stimulus program sustainable while reducing the harm it causes in markets and to the profitability of commercial banks  earlier reports from Reuters  Asahi and Bloomberg have indicated 
Stealth Tapering
 We think they might do something  but nothing that s going to upset the JGB market to any great extent   said Craig Vardy  BlackRock Inc  NYSE BLK   s head of fixed income  Australia 
The BOJ could allow the 10 year bond yield more scope to move from the zero percent that it has targeted  while another option would be to change the wording on a target of increasing holdings of sovereign bonds by 80 trillion yen   723 billion  a year  he said 
The BOJ has already been conducting  stealth tapering  by slowly cutting bond purchases over time  It added slightly less than 50 trillion yen worth of securities to its balance sheet in the year through March 
The dilemma for Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is that even as calls to adjust policy grow louder  persistently weak inflation dictates the need to maintain stimulus  Winding it back would strengthen the yen  further undermining efforts to spur price gains  while also hitting Japanese exporters 
While Kuroda and his board have said they would consider discussing an exit from the stimulus policy from fiscal 2019  they have also consistently reiterated that there would be no change until the BOJ s inflation target of 2 percent has been reached 
 If the BOJ wants to lighten the side effects of its own stimulus  then it will most likely move to a direction to push longer dated JGB yields higher   said Tsuyoshi Ueno  a Tokyo based senior economist at NLI Research Institute  a unit of Nippon Life Insurance  U S  Treasuries will become the biggest casualty if long dated bond JGB yields actually start climbing  given the already high cost of hedging dollar investments  he said ",2018-07-26,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/japans-benchmark-bond-yield-touches-oneyear-high-on-boj-bets-1547512,1547512
433268,MS,INTERVIEW Barclays  Joshi says hiring top equities talent,news,"  Market turmoil making for attractive hiring environment
   Demand for structured products picking up strongly
   Client service levels have dropped
 
 By Simon Falush
 LONDON  June 15  Reuters    Barclays is taking advantage of
the finance sector upheaval to hire the best talent and is
quickly building a competitive European and Asian share trading
operation  head of equities Dixit Joshi told Reuters 
The bank has taken on 450 staff in its equities trading
business and will hire a further 300 by the end of the year  and
the recent market turmoil means it will be able to pick the
cream of the crop  said Joshi  speaking at his office in
Barclays  Canary Wharf headquarters 
 He said hiring in Europe and Asia would complement the
strong position the bank took on when it bought the U S 
operations of Lehman Brothers last September 
  Top talent on the street are really seeking opportunities
where they can operate their franchise in the way they were used
to   Joshi said 
  With many of the firms across the street somewhat
dislocated  top talent is looking to move  We ve hired from
Goldman  from UBS  from Citigroup  from Merrill  Morgan Stanley 
the top equity players  And  from  within those firms we ve
attracted some of the top talent out there  
 He said that with the large number of redundancies and scant
competition from other banks for talent  offering top flight
remuneration packages was no longer necessary to get the best
people 
  This is a great hiring environment   Joshi said   I don t
want to talk about money  but you can read between the lines 
There are more candidates out there than ever before  Top talent
is looking to move for a variety of reasons  
 
 TUMBLING VOLUMES
 Trading volumes  which took a tumble after Lehman Brothers 
collapse and the intensifying financial crisis  have been slow
to recover  and this is forcing banks to look at their business
models  Joshi said 
  Volumes have come off a lot  and that s put pressure on all
participants across the industry to become more efficient 
  We saw a massive deleveraging in the hedge fund space  and
the drop off in asset values has a knock on effect on
commissions  
 One factor making it easy to build up business is client
dissatisfaction caused by standards dipping in the wake of the
financial crisis  Joshi said 
  The industry has been in turmoil and the client hasn t been
looked after in this period  Client service across the street
has taken a dive  Clients are not getting called  they are not
getting service frequently enough  the people they spoke to are
no longer there  
 Joshi said volumes were starting to pick up  and that
looking to build an operation at this point of the cycle leaves
it well positioned to pick up market share from competitors 
  We have seen growth in structured products  which has
picked up in the last three months as investors want to start
generating alpha and want to get their portfolios in shape to
take advantage of conditions that they are seeing right now

289809,AAPL,Sector Returns  November  2014 ,opinion,"Since so much of our earnings work is sector related  here is a quick recap of sector returns for November  14  both from the S P 500 perspective and the SPDR perspective   The first column is the S P 500 sector return per the Wall Street Journal s Saturday  11 29 14 edition  while the 2nd column is the return of the SPDR sector ETF  

Consumer Staples   5 3    6 71 
Consumer Discretionary   5 3    6 86 
Technology   5    6 68 
Health Care   3 2    5 85

Telco   1 1    2 64 
Utilities   0 7    2 82 
Energy   8 8    6 87 
S P 500   4 42    4 43 

 Sources  the Wall Street Journal  WSJ  credits Factset as their source  while my source for the SPRD sector ETF returns was ycharts com  
Personally  I ve been wanting to do this for a while  i e  comparing some of the ETFs to the actual S P 500 sector returns for given periods  If readers just held the SPDR sector ETFs in the same weights as that sector sports within the S P 500  you d have done substantially better than the S P 500 or a normal index fund 
For example  within the SPDR Select Sector   Technology ETF  NYSE XLK   Apple s  NASDAQ AAPL  weight is 17   while AAPL s weight within the S P 500 is roughly 3 5   Naturally AAPL s heavier weighting in the XLK ETF could account for the 168 basis points in extra return for the SPDR ETF  since AAPL was up 11 9  in the month of November  14 alone 
The SPDR ETFs even offered better risk   reward in the losing sector Energy  no doubt given Exxon and Chevron s weights  which are 30  of the market cap of the SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE  combined  Exxon  NYSE XOM  was down 4 11  in the month of November  14 alone  while Chevron  NYSE CVX  fell 6 19  
Please don t misconstrue this post as an infomercial for the SPDRs  I ve always wondered how the sector ETFs compare to sector returns of the ETF universe over time  It is something I d like to spend more time analyzing  Anytime I can write about a topic for readers  I come away learning more about it  and thinking further about our client strategy 
Here is how our top 5 holdings for clients did both in the month of November  first column   and YTD  2nd column  


Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT    3 39    31 30 
Alcoa  NYSE AA    4 35    64 03 
Schwab  NYSE SCHW    4 76    9 92 
Wal Mart  NYSE WMT    14 66    13 40 
Whole Foods  NASDAQ WFM    26 37    14 29 
S P 500   4 42    13 98 

While Microsoft and Alcoa have lagged in Q4  14  their YTD returns are very nice  In hindsight it was prudent to add to Whole Foods under  40 after the disastrous May  14 quarter  Wal Mart has been a core position for a while and is a huge beneficiary of the drop in gasoline prices 
The biggest change in the  Top 5  since the 3rd quarter end  was selling a good chunk of Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Clients still have about 60    65  of the original position  but there is no question the stock has stopped making new highs as the S P 500 has marched higher this year and through the 4th quarter ",2014-11-30,Brian Gilmartin,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/sector-returns:-november,-2014-234135",234135

321283,TGT,Eyes on midterm elections   USD under pressure  AUD is our favorite,opinion,"U S  mid term elections will determine the composition of Congress over the next two years and serve as a first political bellwether ahead of the 2020 presidential elections  Polls suggest that the Republicans will keep a majority in the Senate  while the Democrats may take the House of Representatives  If the Democrats do win the House  their main focus will be to lay the groundwork for the 2020 election  when the party hopes to win back the presidency as well as the majority in the Senate  We do not expect any change in trade policies or an infrastructure program  Instead we expect the Democrats to attempt to use the control they gain over House committees to expose the president  This could be the beginning of the end of Donald Trump  Although financial markets generally like stabilization in politics  a defeat of Donald Trump  who has been recently linked mainly with a trade war  would be welcome 
We think US midterm elections could affect sentiment in the currency market  Following Donald Trump s election as US president on 8 November 2016  the USD rallied sharply  with the Fed s trade weighted US dollar index ending 2016 more than 5  stronger than its pre election level  Despite the correction that followed in 2017  when the index fell almost 10  yoy  many people still associate the Trump administration with USD strength  This impression has probably been shaped by the effect of Trump s protectionist trade policies  which have been responsible for a good part of the 4 4  appreciation of the USD in trade weighted terms since the beginning of the year  The conclusion is   if the Democrats win the House  the dollar could weaken 
If Democrats win  we expect appreciation of commodity currencies  CAD  and especially currencies related to Chinese economy  AUD   On the other hand  safe haven currencies  USD  JPY  are likely to drop

401202,AMZN,Market s Focus On Retail Earnings,opinion,"While it s hard to make much sense of the market s day to day movements at present  there is no such issue with what is expected to happen to Disney    and Macy s    shares in today s session  They both missed the mark in their Q1 earnings releases   Macy s this morning and Disney after the close on Tuesday 
	Even though expectations were fairly low for Macy s to begin with  as the department store bellwether has been struggling for a while now  it missed on the top line as well as on same store sales and guidance for the full year  The retailer blamed continued weakness in the apparel category and  double digit spending reductions by international visitors in major tourist markets where Macy s and Bloomingdale s are key destinations   Macy s recent struggles   the stock price is roughly half of its year earlier level   is a true reflection of the challenging environment for traditional retailers 
	It isn t so much a question of consumer spending  but the relevance of the traditional department store business model in the current environment that forces them to compete simultaneously on two fronts  with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN     stealing their business at one end and discounters at the other end  Macy s isn t alone in its online challenges  many other retailers are in the same boat 
	There is also this emerging narrative of over capacity in the retail space  which is making it difficult for all retail operators  The Fossil    earnings report after the close on Tuesday is an example of this narrative  The stock is down big in the pre open and dragging down the entire retail space 
	Many traditional retailers have still to report Q1 results  but the earnings reporting cycle has effectively ended for most other sectors  We know that earnings and revenue growth was weak across the board this earnings season  a persistent issue over other recent quarters as well  In fact  Q1 was the 4th quarter in a row of earnings declines for the S P 500 index and we are on track for another quarter of negative earnings growth in Q2 
	One relatively positive development this earnings season was the decelerated pace of negative revisions to Q2 estimates compared to other recent periods  Confirmation of this trend at the next earnings cycle later this summer will be the first improvement in the earnings backdrop  raising confidence in future estimates ",2016-05-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market's-focus-on-retail-earnings-200129413,200129413
276546,AAPL,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Apple  Microsoft  Boeing  Amazon com And Alphabet,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   February 25  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Apple Inc    NASDAQ AAPL    Microsoft Corporation   NASDAQ MSFT    The Boeing Company   NYSE BA    Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   and Alphabet Inc    NASDAQ GOOGL   
Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  
Boeing Is the Best Blue Chip Stock for Your Portfolio
Dow Jones Industrial Average is arguably the most important measure of U S  equity prices  This is evident from a simple stat whereby everyday almost five times the number of Americans search for  Dow Jones  in Google compared with  S P   And when it comes to weightings  Apple Inc   4 5   and Microsoft Corporation  2 8   easily falls short of The Boeing Company  10 9    Notably  Amazon com  Inc  and Alphabet Inc  isn t listed in the Dow  which is a price weighted index 
So  logically Boeing is the most important blue chip stock and the biggest Dow component  Further  it is the best performing Dow stock this year by a wide margin  Thanks to its 10 9  weighting  Boeing had contributed more than 700 points to the Dow so far this year  Meanwhile  the next four big names including Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   IBM  NYSE IBM   United Technologies  NYSE UTX  and Home Depot  NYSE HD  contributed only 225  177  157 and 133 points  respectively 
Boeing s Shares Northbound
Going forward  Boeing s shares are widely expected to rise as the firm frequently tops the list of government contractors   Additionally  the Trump administration s interest to rebuild the U S  military by bumping up Pentagon s budget should certainly bode well for the company  Boeing s expected earnings growth for the current year is 25 7   way more than the Aerospace   Defense industry s gain of 3 8  
Further  Boeing has a market value of  230 billion and annual revenues worth of  100 billion  With claims of an order worth  500 billion  the company has secured its position in the near term 
Lest we forget that Boeing s sales rose 8  to  101 billion last year and earnings per share increased a whopping 30  
Boeing Continues to Enhance Shareholders Worth
Boeing has always improved shareholders wealth through dividend payments and share buybacks  The company has consistently paid quarterly dividends for the last eight decades and been increasing its dividend payout once every four quarters for the last seven years  In fact  Boeing s quarterly dividends soared 389  in the last seven years 
In fact  the manufacturer of commercial jetliners  military aircraft  satellites  missile defense  human space flight and launch systems paid out  3 95 billion in dividends last year  almost triple the  1 26 billion it spent in 2011 
At the same time  Boeing initiated its first share buyback program in 2013  Since then  Boeing has repurchased  41 billion worth of its own shares 
Boeing  A Top Ranked Stock
Given the aforesaid positives  Boeing flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   In the past 60 days  nine earnings estimates moved north for the next year  while none moved in the opposite direction  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings rose 11 3  in the same period  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank stocks here 
Boeing flaunts a Growth Score of B and has outperformed the broader industry on a year to date basis   29 5  vs  22 8   
Wall Street s Next Amazon
Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius

292271,BAC,US STOCKS Wall St set to dip on company results  caution,news,"  Data on home prices  consumer confidence on tap
   Office Depot posts wider loss  stock sinks
  Adds quote  byline  updates prices 
 By Ellis Mnyandu
 NEW YORK  July 28  Reuters    U S  stocks headed for a
lower open on Tuesday as a handful of companies  including
Office Depot Inc  posted disappointing quarterly results and
investors turned cautious before key data on home prices and
consumer confidence 
 Although the primary focus remains on second quarter
earnings  investors are eager for economic data  including
Tuesday s Standard   Poor s Case Shiller home price indexes  to
provide further evidence of a recovering U S  economy to
justify a further run up in stocks 
 Office Depot  the No  2 U S  office supply retailer 
reported a bigger than expected quarterly loss as the recession
hurt demand from corporate customers  Office Depot shares fell
16 percent to  4 50 before the bell 
 Viacom Inc  owner of MTV Networks and Paramount film
studios  reported a steep fall in quarterly earnings  hit by
poor advertising revenue and a drop off in sales of its  Rock
Band  video game 
  So much of this rally has been about the absence of new
bad news   said Rick Meckler  president of investment firm
LibertyView Capital Management in New York 
  I think there will be a lot of focus on the Case Shiller
home prices report later this morning  For this rally to really
continue there has to be a shift to some actual positive
forecasts and significantly good news  
 S P 500 futures were 6 20 points lower and were below fair

interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the

294201,TSLA,Forget FANG Woes With These Tech ETFs,opinion,After rebounding strongly from an early February market selloff  the technology sector is once again caught in wild trading thanks to the decline in FANG stocks  This is especially true as the NYSE FANG index  which tracks the 10 biggest and most active tech stocks in the world  slipped into correction territory from its Mar 12 peak As a result  New Tech and Media ETF   AS FNG    which offers similar exposure to investments in high performing technology and media leaders as characterized by the FANG acronym  lost 7 9  over the past 10 days while the ultra popular Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund  shed 7 3  What Happened The initial panic was created by the social media giant Facebook   NASDAQ FB   following the data breach report that sparked concerns about data privacy and security  and will likely lead to increased scrutiny and possible regulatory pressure  Then trade war fears between the two largest economies  United States and China  accelerated the sell off as most of the tech companies do business outside the United States and are highly vulnerable to trade disputes  read    Even though fears of trade war eased the next day and led to a sharp rise in the sector on Mar 26  a slew of negative news again sent the sector into a tailspin on Mar 27  Notably  the NYSE FANG index tumbled 5 6  on the day and eroded about  in market value from the index  NYSE FANG is down 6  since last week  marking the worst plunge ever The latest plunge came as Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   tumbled 8  after it announced the suspension of self driving tests  raising concerns over the new growth areas in the space  Twitter   NYSE TWTR   also dropped 12  on expectations of further regulation on its social media platform while Tesla   NASDAQ TSLA   touched a one year low on Moody s downgrade  All these news have raised concerns over the growth of the hottest technology trends like autonomous cars and artificial intelligence Solid Sector OutlookThe long term outlook for the sector remained promising given the twin tailwinds of Trump s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario  This is because tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from reduced tax rates  These companies are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase payouts to their shareholders  Additionally  the sector s cyclical nature will allow it to perform well in a maturing economic cycle Further  the emergence of cutting edge technology such as cloud computing  big data  Internet of Things  wearables  VR headsets  drones  virtual reality  and artificial intelligence as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as the key catalysts  see    Given this  investors should move on to the tech ETFs that employ some unique smart approach or have less exposure to the big players  Below  we have highlighted some of these and could be excellent bets on bullish industry fundamentals SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF This fund seeks to provide exposure to the most innovative companies with high revenue growth across the technology sector and other industries that deal with technology  such as electronic media  It follows the FactSet Innovative Technology Index  charging investors 45 bps in annual fees  Holding 99 securities  the product has an

363661,HUM,Dow Futures Up Above 200 Points In Pre Market,opinion,Dow futures have rocketed up more than 200 points in this morning s pre market on news that the Senate has passed its version of a tax reform bill in the wee hours of Saturday morning  The corporate tax rate shedding 15 percentage points   35  to 20    is one of the main items the Senate version shares with the House bill  which now faces reconciliation to make its way to President Trump s desk  which he would surely sign Same with the pass through rate and the elimination of the estate tax  In fact  many of the main tenets of each bill fit together  which should help reconciliation  made necessary because the tax cuts were decided on purely party grounds  no Democrats voted for either bill  with only a few defectors from the GOP voting against   There are still some wrinkles that both sides will need to iron out  but because this is far from a bipartisan effort  common ground should be fairly easy to reach More difficult will be those who were against the tax bills before they even saw the contents of them  Now that we can all see what s inside  be prepared to see economists  former Treasury Secretaries  etc  to voice their opposition  Republican representatives of  blue  states   those which tend to follow Democratic policies which generally include higher taxes at state and local levels   should be preparing themselves to hear from their voting constituencies  once these citizens recognize that their taxes are likely to go up  not down In order to help pay for the big tax cuts  elimination of tax write offs such as state and local  medical costs and waived college tuition look to add tax burdens on millions of households  At the same time  wiping out the estate tax  dubbed the  death tax  by supporters of the current bills  and the Alternative Minimum Tax appear to be clear handouts to singularly high wealth individuals  And the drastic corporate tax rate cut will already be a boon to shareholders of publicly traded corporations  another main piece of evidence that these tax reform packages are not aimed at working  and middle class families  as regularly claimed by supporters  but those much farther up the economic food chain All this is to say that the hard work may be yet to come  House Representatives and some Senators also face re election in the coming year  if their voting constituencies see the current tax proposals as being sell outs to the Wall Street upper class   which Candidate Trump explicitly campaigned against  it is worth noting   they may feel the expressed need to make their displeasure known Return of the Vertical MergerPharmacy retailer CVS Health   NYSE CVS   has come to terms to buy managed health care giant Aetna   NYSE T   for a cool  69 billion  This move looks to transform the way health care is managed  with agents of the deal calling the timing  perfect   The idea is that costs for employer supported healthcare will be more effectively managed by joining the retailer with the coverage  Recall a year ago  when a similarly sized merger between Aetna and competitor Humana   NYSE HUM     a horizontal merger  not a vertical one   did not pass antitrust regulation  This morning s vertical arrangement may be seen more palatable by these same regulators That s not to say all vertical merger agreements get a free pass  AT T s   NYSE T   proposal to buy Time Warner   NYSE TWX   faces litigation from none other that the U S  Department of Justice  Government antitrust regulators for this  85  billion deal claim the merger woulds harm competition and raise consumer prices  Yet thus far  we do not hear similar rhetoric from the Justice Department on the CVS Aetna merger  We will keep our ears and eyes open  going forward ,2017-12-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dow-futures-up-above-200-points-in-premarket-200270383,200270383
316927,PG,Should Value Investors Pick Procter   Gamble  PG  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Procter   Gamble Company   NYSE PG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Procter   Gamble has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Procter   Gamble s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Procter   Gamble has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 19 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Procter   Gamble stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Procter   Gamble has a P S ratio of about 3 3  This is marginally lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years As we can see  the stock is trading around its median value for the time period from a P S metric  This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Procter   Gamble currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Procter   Gamble a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Procter   Gamble might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives PG a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current fiscal quarter has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen eight upward and no downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has inched up by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Procter   Gamble Company  The  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineProcter   Gamble is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 43  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Moreover  broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors

289255,AAPL, W ound  T ight  I nside A Triangle,opinion,"Wednesday was an interesting day for global markets  highlighted by the big intraday reversal on Wall Street  After gapping almost 1  higher to start the day  US stocks faded into negative territory an hour before the close as traders expressed their disappointment with Apple s  NASDAQ AAPL   Monster  media event  Not surprisingly  the waning buying pressure in equities spilled over into other markets  with bond yields falling  the US dollar rallying and oil reversing Tuesday s gains 
Zooming in on oil  the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  contract is at a critical technical junction  As we went to press  the commodity was pressing against the bottom of a nearly two week symmetrical triangle pattern at 44 50  That technical pattern is analogous to a person compressing a coiled spring  as the range continues to contract  energy builds up within the spring  When one of the pressure points is eventually removed  the spring explodes in that direction  Currently  the lower bound appears to be in the most trouble  though a late day bounce was still possible 
As a rule  it s notoriously difficult to predict the direction of a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern in advance  but technical oscillators can often provide a valuable leading confirming indication of a breakout  In this case  the RSI indicator is carving out its own descending triangle pattern  so traders should keep an eye on that indicator for possible confirmation of a breakdown in WTI itself 
Beyond risk appetite  the most important fundamental factor that could drive oil prices this week will be Thursday s crude oil inventories report  which is expected to show a 300k barrel build in inventories after last week s surprisingly large 4 7M barrel buildup  Another sign of excess supply could serve as the nudge to confirm a breakdown in  black gold  
If we do see a confirmed downside breakout in WTI  bears will likely target the two week low and 50  Fibonacci retracement at 43 50  potentially followed by the 61 8  retracement at 42 15  On the other hand  a near term recovery in the price of oil  not our base case at this point  could open up the top of the triangle pattern and Tuesday s high at 46 00 next

427140,MS,5 International ETFs Beating S P 500 In 2020,opinion,"The year 2019 was a great one for Wall Street but other corners of the globe did not return in that stellar fashion  Trade war fears  a slowdown in activity and political crisis have weighed on foreign stocks occasionally and led them to trail the U S  Index S P 500  read    
However  the announcement of the phase one U S  China trade deal in the fourth quarter finally offered a big boost to global equities  To add to this  there was the easy money policy  To abate growth concerns  a great cycle of global easing has been set in motion  Australia  New Zealand  India  Turkey  Thailand  South Korea  Indonesia  Brazil  Mexico  South Africa  Malaysia and even the Fed and ECB have been pursuing easy money policies 
At least 20 out of 32 central banks that Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  tracks are   Other key central banks like the Bank of Japan have been maintaining an ultra easy monetary policy  if not slashing further  A wave of cheap money inflows in international markets has finally resulted in foreign equity rally 
 on international stocks for 2020  U S  stocks  in general  outperformed foreign stocks in the past five years with the S P 500 gaining 144 2  versus 66 5  gains in the Schwab International Equity ETF   This probably has made international stocks  valuation more compelling than the U S  ones 
Also  the IMF recently flagged concerns about U S  economic growth  which is expected to slide to 2  in 2020 from an expected 2 3  growth rate in 2019  On the other hand  among advanced economies  Euro area is expected to see an uptick in GDP in 2020 at 1 3  from a 2019 expected growth rate of 1 2   A one bp uptick in growth rate is also expected for the U K  economy at 1 4  for 2020 
Emerging Market and Developing Economies are projected to have grown 3 7  in 2019  and are expected to  and 4 6  in 2021  per IMF read

263227,BAC,7 Reasons To Invest In Bank Of America Heading In 2017,opinion,"There are a few times in the life of an investor when the stars align and you find a trade that you re confident will earn nice return  I m 38 years old  and I ve been investing since I was 18  This trade is only the second time in my life that I feel I found an investment that will easily outperform the S P 500 over next several years 
Bank of America  NYSE BAC  is positioned very well for 2017 and beyond  Below I outline seven reasons why this stock is a good buy heading into the new year 
 1  Valuation
Bank of America s stock price has traded below its book value since the financial crisis  This is not surprising as the big banks have been unpopular since 2008  but that has changed recently 
Despite the recent surge in prices  this stock still looks cheap  Its current price to book value is around 0 90  Meanwhile it traded at two times book value before the crisis  and it s common for banks to trade at two times book during normal times 
Investors have already started to cycle money back into bank stocks  As this trend continues  expect this stock s to price to book value to rise along with its other ratios 
 2  Buybacks
The bank has been buying back its shares for a couple of years  Additionally  Bank of America plans to continue their buyback program by purchasing an additional  5 billion worth of shares over the next 12 months starting in 3Q16 
A buyback can increase a stock s price in several ways 
First it signals to the market that a company thinks its shares are undervalued  As no one knows more about a company than the insiders making the decision to repurchase shares  this is strong indicator that the stock is cheap 
Second the repurchasing company becomes a major buyer of its stock  This gives price support that wouldn t exist without the buyback 
Third a company rarely trades its stock once repurchased  These shares are basically off the market  Per microeconomics  prices increase as supply decreases and demand remains the same  Buybacks effectively decrease the supply of stock 
 3  Dividends
In addition to their buyback program  Bank of America recently increased dividends by 50  and plans to pay  3 billion in dividend payments over the next year  An increase in dividends not only provides investors with additional cash flow  but it signals that management is confident with its financial position and business plan 
 4  Interest rates
Interest rates are increasing  As rates rise  banks earn more interest from loans  This is significant as about 50  of Bank of America s revenue is driven by interest income 
Just last quarter  the bank projected that a   Wall Street expects the Fed to increase rates a few times in 2017  5  Cost Cutting
Bank of America plans to continue cutting costs  This will have a positive impact to its bottom line  The bank is forecasting about  3 billion reduction in costs by 2018 
These savings coupled with higher earnings driven by interest rates will have a positive effect on the bank s earnings  Higher earnings often lead to higher share prices 
 6  Deregulation
A couple of days after Donald Trump was elected  his transition team announced that it plans to  dismantle the Dodd Frank Act   Even if they are not able to completely repeal this legislation  any change would most likely benefit the banks  These changes could allow banks to hold less capital and reduce compliance costs which would lead to higher earnings  These earnings increases could be large and lead to a significant increase in share price 
 7  Corporate Taxes
President elect Trump plans to lower the corporate income tax rate from its current level of 35  to 15   Bank of America s current corporate tax rate is about 30  after deductions  A decrease would benefit the bank s net income and return on equity which again could lead to a higher share price 
Conclusion
There are number of tailwinds that will continue to propel Bank of America s share price in 2017  It s low valuation  company actions to improve investor returns  the interest rate environment  and the political environment all currently favor this company 
So many factors will continue to push this stock higher  that even after the great run it had over the last couple of months  Bank of America is still a good buy heading into the new year

   Financials  oil   gas  basic resources leading losers
   Defensive telecom  pharma stocks gain  Vodafone up 3 7 pct

 By Peter Starck
 FRANKFURT  June 17  Reuters    European shares fell for the
fourth straight session on Wednesday amid doubts about a return
to economic growth  which hammered commodity stocks  and with
banks in the red on fresh concerns about U S  financial sector
health 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 1 9
percent to 845 76 points    its lowest close since May 15    but
remains up 1 7 percent year to date 
  We ve seen a couple of weak days but no radical sell off  
said Commerzbank Chief Strategist Hans Juergen Delp  who
attributed the downward move to a persistent discrepancy between
upbeat sentiment indicators and weak real economy data 
  The sentiment indicators have been positive but have not
been backed up by hard real economic data   he said 
  We need new impulses to kick off sustained gains but no
such impulses are in sight  
 Banks took the most points off the European benchmark index 
 Standard   Poor s lowered its ratings and revised its
outlooks on 22 U S  banks 
  Operating conditions for the industry will become less
favorable     characterized by greater volatility in financial
markets during credit cycles  and tighter regulatory
supervision   S P said  adding the changes also reflected an
ongoing broad ranging reassessment of industry risk for U S 
financial institutions 
 In Europe  Allied Irish Banks tumbled 17 percent  Dexia lost
6 8 percent  Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse both fell 4
percent  and UBS dropped 3 9 percent 
 
 DEMAND WORRIES
 London copper fell to a near two week low as doubts about
the global economic recovery renewed worries over metals demand 

 Among miners  Xstrata plunged 10 2 percent  Rio Tinto lost
7 8 percent  Anglo American fell 6 3 percent and BHP Billiton
was down 3 9 percent 
 Steelmakers also suffered  notably ArcelorMittal  which
dropped 6 4 percent to its lowest close in three weeks 
 Softer oil prices hit energy stocks  with Repsol down 3 2
percent  BP down 2 4 percent and Total down 2 2 percent 
 Economic data on Wednesday showed the euro zone s unadjusted
exports fell 27 percent year on year in April and imports
dropped 28 percent 
 Bank of England policymakers acknowledged recent data on
Britain s economy had been encouraging but stuck with gloomy
projections published in May  minutes to this month s policy
meeting showed 
 The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs lowered its
forecast for the domestic economy to contraction of 2 7 percent
this year and 0 4 percent in 2010  suggesting a deeper and
longer recession than so far anticipated 
 U S  package delivery company FedEx Corp gave an outlook
well below Wall Street estimates  saying the next two quarters
would be  extremely difficult  although there were signs that
the pace of economic decline had slowed 
  The bulls have lost their swagger and after a week long
stalemate  the bears appear to be winning  the  recovery debate 
Financial markets have now broken out of last week s unusually
tight trading range   BetOnMarkets com said in a note 
 
 TRIPLE WITCHING
 Some analysts have said the so called triple witching    the
simultaneous expiry of stock index futures  stock index options
and single stock options    on June 19 could be playing a role 
 Technical analysts  or chartists  at UniCredit  said that
impact may have run its course by now 
  In the last five quarters  expiration effects already
occurred at the beginning of the week     we expect most of the
expected pressure already to have happened   they said in an
equity strategy note 
  The market is clearly missing some real inspiration  
UniCredit said  citing turnover on the New York Stock Exchange 
the trend of which European equity markets tends to follow 
 The day s European gainers were mainly in traditional
defensive sectors such as telecommunications and healthcare  In
telecommunications  Vodafone added 3 7 percent  Deutsche Telekom
 put on 2 1 percent and France Telecom rose 1 6 percent 
 Among healthcare stocks  AstraZeneca was up 2 5 percent and
Sanofi Aventis rose 1 5 percent 
 It was thin on the corporate news front  but some companies
made waves 
 Sainsbury fell 5 7 percent after Britain s third biggest
grocer said it would raise about  700 million to accelerate its
expansion 
  The market isn t buying the capital raising and expansion
plans   ETX Capital said in a note 
  Analysts are concerned that the UK grocery market is
developing into a  barbell  shape  with giant Tesco at one end
and low cost retailers like Morrison s and Asda  part of U S 
WalMart  at the other  Sainsbury s  in this analysis  looks
uncomfortably stuck in the middle   ETX Capital said 
 Shares in K S fell 14 percent after the German fertiliser
and salt maker warned of a bigger drop in earnings and sales
this year than previously forecast  as farmers continue to hold
off on potash orders

264456,BAC,Tech Rout Saps Alpha in Funds That Once Were Crushing Benchmarks,news," Bloomberg     A great year for the biggest class of active funds is becoming merely a good one after a week of upheaval in stocks erased almost half their advantage over the benchmarks they re measured against 
Blame it on an obsession with technology  the industry that had been the market s darling all year before suffering another bout of selling  Worsening the pain has been a rotation into some of this year s biggest laggards  such as telecom and consumer stocks  areas funds have been avoiding 
By some measures  managers who pick stocks among large companies suffered their worst day of the year last Wednesday as the Nasdaq 100 Index trailed the S P 500 by the most in five months  Since then  the group s year to date edge over benchmarks has narrowed to 1 8 percentage points from 3 2 percentage points  according to an analysis by  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co 
Read more on how everyone is attacking big tech  QuickTake Scorecard
While the results showed the group probably stuck to their bets in the face of the rotation  they illustrate the distress for active managers who had been riding the tech rally toward their best year since the bull market began  According to data compiled by Bank of America Corp  NYSE BAC    less than a third of large cap fund managers beat their benchmarks in November  And all this is happening even with stock correlation falling to the lowest levels in 24 years 
 While greater performance differentiation creates more opportunity for stock picking  funds need to be positioned in the right stocks for it to translate into positive alpha   Savita Subramanian  a strategist at Bank of America  wrote in a Dec  4 note   This was not the case  
Agony is also being felt by bears  As money flowed to the once hated stocks such as retailers  bearish wagers backfired for short sellers  A Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  basket of most shorted stocks climbed in all but one of the 12 days through Monday  a stretch not seen in three years 
For now  mutual fund managers can take comfort in that they re still beating the market  Indeed  while the proportion of outperforming funds fell to 49 percent from 55 percent in October  it s still the highest hit rate at this time of the year since at least 2009  data from Bank of America showed 
Moreover  tech stocks have stemmed a further deterioration in performance this week  For a second day in a row  they led the 11 industries in the S P 500  That s an improvement from the previous four days  when the group trailed the benchmark index by more than 5 percentage points 
 While it s days like these that can bring portfolio managers to their knees  the numbers don t suggest it s bringing them to reposition   Chris Harvey  head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo  wrote in a note Tuesday   Away from the day to day  it s been a good year for active management but just an OK month  ",2017-12-06,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tech-rout-saps-alpha-in-funds-that-once-were-crushing-benchmarks-961773,961773
221914,UBER, Fix this disaster   Hope and fear as Argentina welcomes Peronists back to power,news,"By Cassandra Garrison and Joan Manuel Santiago Lopez
BUENOS AIRES  Reuters    Roxana Gonzalez  a bookshop owner in Buenos Aires  has a plea for new Argentine President Alberto Fernandez  who takes over power on Tuesday amid the pressures of recession  heavy debt and inflation 
 What I want is to fix this disaster   Gonzalez said at her bookstore on a busy avenue in Buenos Aires  with a large sign reading  liquidation  hanging above the entrance 
Gonzalez  46  has sharply felt the downturn  which saw Argentina slip into recession last year  closing four bookstores she owned with her husband  Now  she manages the one remaining store while her husband drives for U S  ride sharing platform Uber  NYSE UBER  
 These four years were an economic disaster for us   Gonzalez said  referring to outgoing President Mauricio Macri s term since the end of 2015 in which time the peso has plummeted against the dollar  growth has stalled and annual inflation has jumped to above 50  
Fernandez  a center left Peronist who ran with populist ex leader Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  faces a tough challenge to revive the economy  with dwindling foreign reserves and looming debt repayments threatening to push Argentina into default 
His fledgling government will need to negotiate debt restructuring with creditors including the International Monetary Fund to avoid being shut out of global markets  while reviving domestic demand to help people like Gonzalez 
Not everyone is convinced  however  with many fearing that the Peronists   the top political power in Argentina s recent history   will usher in protectionist policies that could aggravate the situation further 
Fernandez de Kirchner  the incoming vice president  divides opinion sharply among voters and markets  She raised export taxes on the key farm sector and imposed tough capital controls during her twin terms from 2007 2015 
 For me  with Fernandez it will be the same as it was with Cristina   said Macri supporter Joana Paredes  22  a mobile phone seller in the capital who fears a sharp shift to the left 
 I am worried about these next four years in Argentina and the situation around Latin America because there are problems in Bolivia and Chile   she said   You never know what can happen  
For Gonzalez things can only get better 
 I don t care if Alberto and Cristina rule together or separately  That s their business and I m not interested   she said  adding all she wanted was Fernandez to focus on reviving growth and fixing the economy 
In March next year  her rental contract for the last store is due to expire and Gonzalez said she does not know if they will be able to stay open  She hoped to hold on to the rest of the books to sell to a collector but says she needs the cash now 
 I have to liquidate because I need the money   she said ",2019-12-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/fix-this-disaster-hope-and-fear-as-argentina-welcomes-peronists-back-to-power-2037861,2037861
441577,WFC,GLOBAL MARKETS Stocks rally on Chinese  U S  data as euro gains,news,"  Less grim Chinese  U S  data revive investor optimism
   Chinese inflation high but within central bank control
   Global stocks rally  S P pct rise biggest since April
   Euro  oil  gold strengthen  bonds tumble
  Recasts lead  updates market action  adds fresh quote 
 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK  June 14  Reuters    Chinese data showing the
world s second biggest economy might be able to avoid a hard
landing and U S  retail sales data that was not as weak as
feared lifted stocks  oil and other growth oriented markets on
Tuesday 
 In the currency market  emboldened investors drove up the
euro despite lingering jitters over Greece s debt problems
after it became S P s lowest rated sovereign borrower  The
renewed appetite for risk  however  routed low risk government
bonds 
 China s inflation accelerated to its fastest level in
almost three years  and its industrial output grew a solid 13
percent from a year ago  Its central bank  in an effort to curb
inflation  later increased the reserve requirement ratio for
commercial lenders by 50 basis points  For details  see
 ID nL3E7HE05P 
 The data showed inflation at multi year highs  but did not
worsen fears that it is running out of the control  This raised
hopes that Chinese policy makers could gradually tighten policy
to cool local wage growth and its red hot property market
without subtracting too much from overall growth  a so called
soft landing 
  People are waiting to see whether there will be a soft
landing or a hard landing in China  Based on the data
overnight  the odds are favoring a soft landing  It s making
people more optimistic   said Brian Jacobsen  chief portfolio
strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls 
Wisconsin  which oversees  400 billion in assets 
 In the United States  retail sales in May fell for the
first time 11 months  but the drop was less than expected 
signaling the resilience of American consumers despite sluggish
job growth and a lousy housing market   ID nN14189765 
  We were seeing an over reaction in the last few days to a
slowdown in the economy  At some point  we will get a better
tone in consumer spending and overall growth rate   said Frank
Germack  director of the investment department at Rehmann
Financial in Troy  Michigan 
 The U S  stock market jumped  with the Dow Jones industrial
average  up 163 97 points  or 1 37 percent  at 12 116 94 
The Standard   Poor s 500 Index  was up 19 70 points  or
1 55 percent  at 1 291 53  The Nasdaq Composite Index 
was up 44 86 points  or 1 70 percent  at 2 684 55 
 The S P 500 is on track for its biggest one day percentage
rise since March  shaving its month to date loss to 4 percent 
 Top European stocks  rose 0 8 percent  while
Tokyo s Nikkei  ended 1 0 percent higher 
 Some analysts cautioned the gains in stocks and risky
markets could be short lived as sovereign debt problems in
Europe and the United States fester and the Federal Reserve s
 600 billion bond program expires at the end of June 
  A one day rally is not going to change the situation  
said Robbert Van Batenburg  head of global research at Louis
Capital Markets in New York 
 GREECE SELLS DEBT
 Also reducing investor anxiety was Greece s ability to
raise short term funds after Standard   Poor s downgraded its
rating closer to default territory   ID nN13126859 
 Greece sold 1 625 billion euros   2 33 billion  of 6 month
T bills at a yield of 4 96 percent  This was higher than May s
4 88 percent but attracted a larger percentage of foreign
buyers than the previous auction  reflecting market
expectations Greece will secure a second rescue package worth
about 120 billion euros to stave off default 
 On the other hand  the cost of insuring Greek debt against
default over five years rose to record peak of 1 615 basis
points  as did the yield on Greek government bonds 
 ID nLDE75D0ZT 
 Greece s trials did little to discourage investors from
buying the euro 
 The euro rebounded a day after it hit a record low against
the Swiss franc   The Swiss currency  which falls
when investors turn away from safe havens  declined more than
0 9 percent versus the euro and the U S  dollar 
 The euro rose to  1 4480 against the greenback  up 0 5
percent on the day  
 Investors also channeled money into commodities at the
expense of government bonds 
 ICE Brent July crude  rose 88 cents to  119 98 a
barrel  touching its highest level in more than five weeks 
U S  oil futures  were up 1 6 percent at  98 88 
 Spot gold  climbed to  1 523 29 an ounce from
 1 514 73 on Monday when it suffered its biggest one day loss
in a month  touching a three week low of  1 511 11 
 A sell off in the U S  government bond markets pushed
benchmark yields to their highest level in almost two weeks at
3 08 percent  German Bund futures fell 54 basis points at
125 40 after posting a contract high of 126 11 on Monday

296009,TSLA,Are You Ready For The US Lithium Ion Battery Boom  ,opinion,"Despite gold correcting  major investment interest increases for the lithium ion battery market which is growing at a breathtaking pace  Demand could double over the next decade as the US is now developing a lithium battery supply chain which could emerge over the coming years 

The bellwether leader in the sector Tesla Motors Inc  NASDAQ TSLA  and Samsung  LONDON 0593xq  Electronics PK  OTC SSNLF  have already committed to building a  5 billion Battery Factory near Reno  Nevada 

 that Western Lithium  WLC TO or WLCDF  could be the major source of lithium for the electric batteries used in cars and smart grids  Western Lithium USA Corporation  TO WLC  owns the Kings Valley Lithium Deposit in northern Nevada which is one of the largest assets in the world of this critical resource 



Western Lithium recently released an important development on the lithium processing  They produced 99 8  high quality lithium carbonate in the first trial run at its demonstration plant  This could cause major interest from potential strategic partners who have already expressed interest to partner with the company to accelerate development of the asset  These end users need a domestic and secure supply 





Western Lithium s CEO Jay Chmelauskas said    The lithium market now appears ready for Western Lithium to accelerate the development of its Nevada lithium deposit as a new major supply source  Nevada is emerging as the world s largest lithium battery manufacturing center and provides potential synergies for Western Lithium to establish its business locally and to become integrated with the global battery supply chain  

See the full news release on the lithium carbonate produced at their demo plant by  

I believe the lithium ion battery market especially in Nevada could be an area of strength in 2015 as it was the past two years  Western Lithium could be swallowed up by a larger entity as it is worth only  70 million  Remember that number is a small fraction of the  5 billion price tag that Tesla and Samsung will be shelling out to build this gigafactory 

Lithium is a key ingredient to batteries and Western Lithium owns the major US deposit  Tesla may be a household name right now but don t be surprised to see Western Lithium discussed at dinner parties after it partners with a major end user possibly this year 



The chart on Western Lithium is excellent over the past two years and appears to be forming a classic bullish flag  Another round of accumulation like we saw in 2014 could be on the agenda  The base is almost one year in the making  The stock is just beginning to come off the bottom of the flag and breaking over the 200 day moving average  Look for a golden crossover of the 50 and 200 day moving average to confirm the next move higher 

Disclosure  I own Western Lithium and the company is a website sponsor  Please do your own due diligence  For informational purposes only  This is not investment advice ",2015-04-03,Jeb Handwerger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-ready-for-the-us-lithium-ion-battery-boom-247211,247211

274113,AAPL,FireEye  FEYE  Q2 Earnings Lag Estimates  Down Y Y  View Cut,opinion,FireEye Inc    NASDAQ FEYE   reported second quarter 2019 non GAAP loss of 1 cent per share against break even earnings in the prior year quarter  Moreover  the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of a penny Revenues totaled  218 million  which increased 7  year over year  and outpaced the consensus estimate of  215 million Strong demand for threat intelligence and managed defense solutions  and Mandiant services boosted the top line FireEye  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Quarter DetailsProduct and related subscription  and support revenues decreased 4  year over year to  117 5 million  reflecting a  24 million decline in the opening current deferred revenue balance for the segment  This stemmed from a fall in appliance hardware sales  which occurred in 2016 and 2017 but is still realized due to the ASC 606 revenue accounting standards Sales of appliances accounted for nearly 31  of the total product and related category  up 24  year over year  attributed to the end of life of older third generation appliances  This led to a surge of network and email hardware refreshes Quarterly billings increased 13  backed by 27  year over year growth in platform  cloud subscription  and managed services category  Billings did not include any transactions higher than  10 million Notably  Mandiant Professional Services also performed well in the second quarter  Revenues from this segment were up 15  from the year ago quarter to  46 million FireEye completed the acquisition of Verodin during the quarter Moreover  the Helix platform witnessed increased engagement  The company launched the early adopter program for the next generation of the platform  which is receiving positive feedback  The next generation of Helix is expected to be launched later this year FireEye secured 45 transactions greater than a  1 million  nearly 67  of which included services or expertise on demand Overall transaction volume increased with both Global 2000 customers as well as in the mid market  In the second quarter  261 new customers were added However  annual run rate  ARR  for the product and related subscriptions category declined  20 million sequentially in the second quarter  primarily due to the expiration of subscriptions and support of certain third generation appliances Operating ResultsNon GAAP gross margin contracted 300 basis points  bps  year over year to 72  Non GAAP operating margin was negative 1   down 300 bps due to an 8  year over year rise in operating expenses The expense rise stemmed primarily from R D and sales and marketing  Higher investment in product innovation and next generation Helix platform led to higher R D expenses Increased commission expenses associated with higher sales performance and accelerated growth in new business resulted in higher sales and marketing expenses Further  operating expenses included the financial impact of Verodin being part of the company for the last month of the reported quarter However  as a percentage of billings  operating expenses declined from 75  to 72   reflecting continued leverage in long term business model Balance Sheet   Cash FlowFireEye exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of approximately  987 7 million  down from  1 13 billion at the end of the previous quarter The company s cash flow from operation was  9 5 million compared with  24 5 million in the first quarter GuidanceFor third quarter 2019  FireEye anticipates revenues to be between  217 million and  221 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at  215 2 million  implying 6 17  growth from the year ago reported figure  This reflects a  23 million decrease in current deferred revenues in the product and related category Billings are projected in the range of  245  255 million  Non GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be 72   Non GAAP operating margin is estimated in the band of 0  to 2   suggesting a sequentially flat to lower operating expenses accruing to lower payroll taxes Capital expenditure of about  10 million is expected in the third quarter Non GAAP earnings per share are expected in the 0 2 cents range  The midpoint of 1 cent matches the consensus estimate Operating cash flow is expected be within  15

and 4 cents per share  down from previous guidance of 17 21 cents The decline in ARR of product and related subscriptions lowered FireEye s outlook  However  the fact that there s less than  3 million in ARR left for the third generation appliances  product and related ARR is expected to stabilize and return to growth by virtue of the new cloud based network security and server based detection solutions Moreover  lower upfront revenues are expected for the year Further  an increase in the mix of appliance billings is expected  which is likely to lengthen the revenue recognition period to 48

Some of the proponents of an interest rate hike this year have called upon their peers to view last month s slowdown in job creation in the context of an economy that is nearing full employment  However  when considering all of the positions put forth by Fed officials  it is likely that an interest rate hike won t be seen until March of next year

U S  markets ended higher on Thursday following the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve s latest policy meeting  However  early day trading wasn t nearly as positive  Investors were concerned as they awaited more details on why the Fed decided not to raise interest rates last month  Although nothing surprising was mentioned in the minutes  the fact that a U S  central bank is so concerned over global economic growth as well as the U S  economy s ability to thrive within that ecosystem has investors on edge

Excluding this expense  adjusted income from continuing operations totaled  39 9 million  or  0 82 per diluted share  non GAAP   which compares to our guidance of adjusted income from continuing operations of  0 66 to  0 72 per diluted share  non GAAP   
Big Lots  net sales for the first quarter increased 2 5  to  1 3 billion  as the company s comparable store sales increase was partially offset by a lower store count compared to last year 
The company also revised its guidance for both the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and the entire fiscal 2016  For the second quarter Big Lots estimate adjusted income from continuing operations will be in the range of  0 42 to  0 47 per diluted share  non GAAP   compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of  0 41 per diluted share  non GAAP  for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 
This guidance is based on an estimated comparable store sales in the range of flattish to an increase of 2  compared to a 2 8  comparable store sales increase in Q2 of fiscal 2015

324529,TGT,UPDATE 1 Czech budget gap widens far beyond full year plan,news,"  Five mth budget gap widens to nearly twice full yr target
   Analysts see full year deficit near 200 billion crowns
   Govt struggles with 2010 budget plan
N    
  Adds finmin comments on 2009 and 2010 outlook 
 PRAGUE  June 1  Reuters    The Czech budget deficit jumped
to nearly double the original full year plan in the first five
months of this year as the economic crisis hit revenues 
 The Finance Ministry said on Monday the central government
budget gap swelled to 71 4 billion crowns   3 79 billion  for
the first five months of 2009  far above the planned full year
deficit of 38 1 billion 
 Overall revenues dropped by 3 percent from the same period
last year to 400 billion crowns  while expenditure rose 4 6
percent  the Ministry said 
 Czech gross domestic product fell 3 4 percent in the first
quarter  reducing all types of tax payments  The budget was
drafted last summer when the ministry forecast 4 8 percent
economic growth this year 
 The budget gap for the five months equals about 1 9 percent
of estimated full year gross domestic product  It excludes local
government budgets and various funds that together make up the
national fiscal system 
 The Finance Ministry has said it expects the full year
overall fiscal gap at 4 5 percent of GDP and the central
government budget deficit to reach 150 billion crowns 
 But that will require savings  and analysts see an even
bigger shortfall 
  The budget deficit may head to 200 billion crowns by the
end of the year   said David Marek  chief economist at Patria
Finance 
  Keeping it below this milestone would be difficult and
would need expenditure cuts by the current government  It is
difficult because it would be desirable to provide positive
fiscal stimulus for the economy but there is no scope for
further stimulus  
 But Finance Minister Eduard Janota said after the May
figures that a 150 billion full year gap was still realistic 
 The government has more than doubled its gross borrowing
target to 280 billion crowns this year 
 The ministers discussed the 2010 budget plan on Monday but
interrupted the discussion due to demands by the Transport
Ministry for an extra 50 billion crowns for road construction 
 Janota told a news conference he rejected the plan unless it
was accompanied by savings in order to stick to the government s
limit of 170 billion crowns central state budget deficit 
 The Finance Ministry has proposed a 165 billion crown gap
for next year  which would require a wage freeze and 5 20
percent cuts in discretionary spending 
 The budget will be completed by a new parliament after an
election in October and the leftist Social Democrats  who have
strong chances of forming the next cabinet  have spoken against
strict spending cuts

433546,C,What The Buy Side Expects From Citigroup,opinion,"Citigroup Inc   NYSE C   is set to report FQ2 2014 earnings before the market opens on Monday  July 14th  Reports suggest that Citigroup is in talks with the Depart of Justice to finally settle a  7 billion lawsuit related to allegations that the bank sold subprime mortgages leading up to the financial crisis in 2008  While most companies in the S P 500 are expected to have a strong earnings season  the financials are an exception  Most banks are expected to report an earnings downturn this quarter  Wall Street is forecasting that Citigroup will report EPS of  1 08  down 17c  14   from the same quarter of last year   However  investors are less pessimistic than the sell side  
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Citigroup to report  1 08 EPS and  18 800B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 36 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  1 13 EPS and  19 074B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Citigroup to beat the Wall Street earnings consensus by close to 5  while reporting 1  to 2  ahead of revenue estimates 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Citigroup s EPS in each quarter and has been more accurate in predicting revenue 4 times  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing an average differential between the two groups  expectations 

The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 65c to  1 29 per share and from  18 000B to  20 230B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing an unusually wide range of estimates on Citigroup compared to previous quarters 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wide range of earnings estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Over the past 3 months the Wall Street EPS consensuses declined from  1 25 to  1 08 while the Estimize consensus plunged from  1 33 to  1 13  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue forecast slowly decreased from  19 523B to  18 800B while the Estimize consensus slipped from  21 300B to  19 074B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward analyst revisions going into an earnings report are often a bearish indicator 

Among the analysts with at least 2 estimates scored on Citigroup  ZachLehner has been the most accurate with an average of 10 25 points per estimate  ZachLehner is a buy side equity research analyst who is currently ranked 6th overall among over 4 550 contributing analysts  ZachLehner will be featured in a conference call highlighting a few of the top performing Estimize analysts on Monday  July 21st to discuss earnings for the consumer discretionary sector 
Data from Estimize com suggets that we may be in for the best earnings season since the fourth quarter of 2011  With that being said  no fireworks are expected from the banks  On Friday Wells Fargo reported EPS of  1 01  coming in line with Wall Street but missing the Estimize consensus by 4c per share  Wells Fargo reported a slip in mortgage revenues which helped keep earnings lower than the Estimize community had forecast  On Monday we will see if Wells Fargo s miss against the Estimize consensus was an isolated incident  or if more weakness from the banks can be expected going forward ",2014-07-13,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-the-buy-side-expects-from-citigroup-219216,219216

   Dollar index up 0 2 percent
   Moves exacerbated by thin holiday conditions
   Euro zone mfg PMI falls to 33 9 in December  11 yr low

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON  Jan 2  Reuters    The dollar started 2009 on a firm
tone on Friday  with the euro on the defensive after retreating
broadly earlier in the session on perceptions that the single
currency s recent rally may have been overdone 
 A fall in euro zone manufacturing activity to an 11 year low
didn t help the already soft sentiment toward the euro  while 
trade was choppy as liquidity remained thin with Tokyo and other
Asian markets closed for the New Year holidays 
 The euro lost ground against the dollar and fell back from
record peaks against sterling  as a drive towards parity ran out
of steam 
  There was a lot of profit taking in long dollar positions
 in recent sessions   Illiquid markets have exacerbated the
euro s recent rally   said Lee Hardman  currency economist at
Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ 
 Market players were also starting to turn against the euro
on the view that European growth will likely suffer for longer
on expectations the European Central Bank will continue taking a
gradualist approach to cutting rates  compared with other
central banks which have eased aggressively 
 By 0908 GMT  the euro was down 0 3 percent against the
dollar at  1 3949  having earlier hit a session low of  1 3841 
 The single currency was at 95 54 pence  after dropping more
than one percent in Asian trade  taking its losses in the past
two trading days to three percent 
 Earlier this week it hit a record 98 05 pence 
  The fall in euro sterling is likely the result of
profit taking on sterling shorts with the pair having been deep
in overbought territory and most of the bad news for the UK
economy having already been priced in   said David Powell 
currency strategist at Bank of America 
 On the data front  the final reading of the Markit Eurozone
Purchasing Managers Index  PMI  for the manufacturing sector
fell to 33 9 in December  a low not seen in the survey s 11 year
history and well below the 34 5 flash estimate and 34 5 forecast
by economists 
 Traders will also keep a close eye on U S  Institute for
Supply Management s December manufacturing index at 1500 GMT on
Friday  Markets expect a reading of 35 5 versus 36 2 in
November 
 The dollar index  a gauge of its performance against six
major currencies  rose 0 2 percent to 81 30 
 Against the yen  the dollar was up 0 3 percent to 91 10 
 Although extremely volatile moves seem to have subsided
recently  risk aversion is expected to remain a factor in 2009 
especially as major economies are headed for a steep downturn
before recovery 
  Financial conditions may continue to improve gradually  but
economic distress will likely keep risk aversion high   said

423211,GM,Automakers say Trump s threatened Mexico tariffs would cost billions,news,By Nick Carey DETROIT  Reuters    Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday that U S  President Donald Trump s proposal to slap tariffs on Mexican made goods could cost its major suppliers  1 billion  highlighting growing concern in the U S  auto sector about the potential damage of a new front in the Trump administration s trade wars  Trump has said he will apply tariffs of 5  on Mexican goods on June 10 if Mexico does not halt the flow of illegal immigration  largely from Central America  across the U S  Mexican border  Those tariffs would gradually rise to 25  by Oct  1 if Mexico does not satisfy Trump s demands   Faced with this threat  major automakers are also planning to delay some vehicle shipments from Mexico  people briefed on the plans told Reuters on Tuesday  The shipment delays would affect vehicles with high inventory levels on U S  dealer lots if the tariffs take effect as threatened  Automakers are trying to speed some critical parts shipments this week ahead of the Monday deadline  Consultancy LMC Automotive said on Tuesday the industry could absorb a 5  percent tariff for a month  but that a sustained period at the 25  tariff level would have a potentially devastating impact on the auto industry and cut U S  new vehicle sales by up to 1 5 million units annually   A prolonged period of tariffs on Mexican imports would likely push Mexico into recession and could also threaten a recession in the United States   LMC said  In 2018  automakers sold 17 3 million new vehicles in the United States  LMC said prices on models imported from Mexico could increase by an average of  8 500  while the average price of a vehicle sold in the U S  market could rise by as much as  2 500 3 000 when parts for assembly in the United States are factored in   In an email seen by Reuters  Toyota Motor Corp told its U S  dealers the duties could cost its major suppliers between  215 million and  1 07 billion  The email  dated June 3  from Toyota s North American sales chief  Bob Carter  also told dealers that 65  of the Tacoma midsize pickup trucks the Japanese automaker plans to sell in the U S  market in 2019 will be imported from its plant in Baja  Mexico  On Tuesday Kevin Clark  chief executive at auto supplier Aptiv PLC told investors at a conference in Boston that a 5  tariff would cost it around  17 million per month   Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Montreal on Tuesday  Steve Kiefer  senior vice president  global purchasing and supply chain at General Motors Co  NYSE GM   declined to discuss how much tariffs could cost but said  the single biggest problem we have is the uncertainty with tariffs    Right now  we re asking all of our suppliers to be calm and not do anything drastic   Kiefer said   Automakers are pressing Republican senators on Capitol Hill to contact the White House to try to convince the president not to move ahead with the tariffs  the people briefed on the matter told Reuters  U S  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday there was  not much support  among his fellow Republicans for the tariffs ,2019-06-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-toyota-tells-us-dealers-mexico-tariffs-could-cost-suppliers-up-to-1-billion-1887967,1887967
280704,AAPL,Check Out This Top Ranked REIT With A Double Digit Dividend Yield ,opinion,"Real Estate prices have been rising steadily lately and thanks to rising bond yields  mortgage rates are climbing as well   It can be difficult however for individual investors to participate in the real estate market as owning individual properties involves laying out large amounts of cash and either hands on active management or costly professional management fees 
One simple way to participate in the hot properties market is through the purchase of shares in a Real Estate Investment Trust  REIT  that owns a diversified portfolio of income producing real estate assets and or mortgages and is required by law to pass through at least 90  of taxable income to shareholders  REITs are also generally tax efficient because the dividends are taxed at individual rate  rather than as corporate profits   
Real estate investments played a key role in the financial crisis of 2007 2009   A combination of rapidly rising home prices and lax lending standards   including  sub prime  borrowing in which mortgages were underwritten on properties owned by unqualified buyers   contributed to a rapid decline in home values and record levels of mortgage defaults 
Housing prices declined more than 20  between their peak in 2006 and September of 2008  and greater than 10  of all borrowers owed more than their properties were worth  The widespread securitization of mortgage notes spread the financial pain of delinquencies and defaults to many major institutions across the spectrum of financial services   
Savvy investors scooped up distressed properties during the crisis and the subsequent recovery has rewarded many of them with handsome profits   
Mortgages as a Real Estate Asset
Another smart investment is in the mortgages of distressed properties  which in many cases can be purchased at steep discounts to the original loan value  As U S  treasuries pull back off recent highs  income producing investments like REITs look increasingly attractive 
PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust   born in the midst of the crisis in 2008  purchases lightly distressed mortgage notes from banks and lending institutions who no longer want to have them on the books and then uses what the company describes as a  high touch  approach in dealing with the property owners to make the notes perform once again as income producing assets 
In many cases  because of the discount to face value at which the loans were purchased  PennyMac is in a position to offer loan modifications in rates  terms and loan balances that allow the owners to keep the properties and make payments on schedule  Rising real estate prices mean those owners have a financial incentive to make a deal with PennyMac and stay current on their payment schedule 
Attractive financing through the Ginnie Mae MSR financing structure allows Penny Mac the borrow at rates that are much lower than the portfolio of loans it owns 
Using an industry leading platform to pursue opportunities in the mortgage markets  PennyMac has a strong history of earnings growth  while remaining focused on quality and governance   Steady earnings from its growing portfolio allow the company to consistently pay a dividend in excess of 10  annually  They have paid a double digit dividend in each of the previous 20 quarters 
PennyMac reported earnings of  0 35 share in Q1  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 31 share   Full year 2018 earnings are now predicted to be  1 66 share  27  higher than in 2017   
PennyMac is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Earnings were spread across the company s three divisions  Production  Servicing and Investment Management   While rising rates hurt production revenues as fewer new loans were originated  the shortfall was more than made up for in servicing  where PennyMac benefited from higher mortgage rates   Notably  the company ended the quarter with  137million on the balance sheet  a 300  increase over the previous quarter 
Aren t High Dividends a Red Flag 
In many cases  investors are wise to steer clear of stocks that pay very high dividends on the logic that if the market is not valuing the shares based on the yield  either the future of the dividend is in doubt  or the company has operational difficulties that are likely to drag the share price lower 
This is generally good logic  though neither seems to be the case right now with PennyMac   REITs certainly have different characteristics than conventional stocks and while rising mortgage rates and home prices have helped PennyMac for the past decade  a reversal in either of those trends would hurt the company   
This is not an  income  stock for investors who need the income to live  but as part of a diverse portfolio  a 10  yield is hard to pass up More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market  Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ",2018-05-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/check-out-this-top-ranked-reit-with-a-doubledigit-dividend-yield-200320343,200320343

Tuesday s trade setback came after Trump said on Monday that the U S  would restore tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina  Plus  the Trump administration proposed tariffs on French imports as retaliation for France s digital services tax  which impacts U S  tech companies such as Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   and Google   NASDAQ GOOGL

381064,AMZN,3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week  Walmart  CVS  Wayfair,opinion,"After suffering huge losses during the final days of 2018  suddenly it seems all is good again for stock investors  The U S  and China appear to be inching closer to a trade deal that could remove the uncertainty that s been shadowing markets for months  Indeed  on Friday  President Donald Trump confirmed this  then added that he might extend the March 1 deadline for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods 
This alone has the potential to spur this bull run on for another year  Another powerful signal came from U S  consumer sentiment which rebounded from a two year low  further fueling the rally in stocks that sent the S P 500 to a 10 week high 
Though global trade continues to dominate markets  there remain some big earning reports scheduled for the coming week  We re focusing on three stocks which could see some volatility after their companies announce Q4 2018 numbers and release future outlooks 
1  Walmart
The world s largest brick and mortar retailer is scheduled to report its fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday  Feb  19  before the market opens  On average  analysts see  1 33 a share profit on the sales of  138 66 billion 

One of the biggest worries Walmart  NYSE WMT  investors continue to pay attention to is how the retailer will keep improving its margins when costs continue escalating  Along with controlling costs  Walmart also needs to show that its e commerce strategy is well on track to counter online competitors  including Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  as well as digital upstarts that are attracting millennial shoppers in droves 
Given these challenges  in our view  Walmart s quarterly report card thus far has been impressive  A turnaround in same store sales  which started in the third quarter of fiscal 2015  has gained pace in the company s fiscal 2019 
As of its most recent report on Nov  15  2018  comparable store sales rose yet again  for a total of 16 consecutive quarters  Walmart shares  which closed at  99 99 on Friday  have gained 7 3  so far this year  We believe the stock will see additional gains if the retailer continues to show strong growth in the same store sales and further expansion in its e commerce business 
2  CVS Health
CVS Health  NYSE CVS  reports on Wednesday  Feb  20  before the market opens  Concerns persist regarding the integration costs on its  69 billion merger with Aetna  NYSE AET   which closed in late November  making the merged entity one of the largest health care insurance and benefits companies in the industry 
The merger is a way for CVS to beef up its brick and mortar operations with the services side of the industry  a response to Amazon s efforts at taking on the healthcare industry  Though investors have liked this deal  integration challenges could force the company to lower its guidance for 2019 

During the past three months  CVS stock has fallen 12   massively underperforming the S P 500  However  good news on the Aetna merger and signs of cost controls could push the stock higher  breaking the bearish spell  Trading at  69 53  the stock remains well below analysts  12 month consensus price target of  88 57 a share 
For Wednesday s earnings report  consensus estimates call for CVS to post  2 05 a share profit  up from  1 92 a year ago  Sales are likely to jump 13  to  54 58 billion 
3  Wayfair
Price action may be extraordinarily volatile after online furniture retailer Wayfair  NYSE W  reports its Q4 earnings on Friday  Feb 22  before the markets open  Analysts have honed in on the company s growing losses  worsening free cash flow and surging market spending 

When the company reported its Q3 earnings in November it missed expectations  Shares plunged 17  afterward 
Though the stock has since recovered those losses  at  122 11 per share as of Friday s close  it s still trading 23  below its 52 week high of  151 2  As well  risks to downside still remain elevated  analysts expect losses to widen to  1 28 a share from  0 58 during the year ago period  However  sales are likely to expand by 37  to  1 97 billion 
There s little doubt the company has mastered the art of selling big ticket furniture items online globally  Still  it has yet to show how it can do this profitably  The stakes for Wayfair to show a path to profitability quickly  are high  especially when bigger rivals  such as Amazon  are getting ready to enter the online furniture sales arena ",2019-02-17,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-watch-in-the-coming-week-walmart-cvs-wayfair-200389090,200389090
413891,JNPR,Will Juniper  JNPR  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR   This company  which is in the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This computer network equipment maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 13 12  
For the last reported quarter  Juniper came out with earnings of  0 59 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 57 per share  representing a surprise of 3 51   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 44 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 54 per share  delivering a surprise of 22 73  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Juniper  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Juniper currently has an Earnings ESP of  10   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 25  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-juniper-jnpr-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200408803,200408803

391534,LEN,Zacks Investment Ideas Feature Highlights  M I Homes  Lennar  KB Home  Lyon William Homes And M D C  Holdings,opinion,"For Immediate Release 

	Chicago  IL   June 22  2017   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  M I Homes  NYSE           Lennar  NYSE           KB Home  NYSE           Lyon William Homes  NYSE          and M D C  Holdings  NYSE          

Why Home Builder Stocks Are Hot Right Now

	I often look for strong stocks in strong sectors by looking at the Zacks Industry Rank page  The semiconductor equipment stocks has been at the top for some time now  as those stocks have seen plenty of positive earnings estimate revisions 

	One industry that is seeing some negative revisions to earnings estimates but has seen stock price increases is the home builder industry  On a YTD basis  the home builders are crushing it  up 27  compared to about 10  for the IVV  S P 500   The industry rank for the home builders is 48 of 256 so that puts it in the top 19  

Only One  1

	The group has only one stock that is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and that is M I Homes  NYSE          which saw a huge move on the earnings release back in late April  The company posted a 44  positive earnings surprise and has traded over  29 following the report as was stuck under  25 before the release 

	That report drove the lone positive earnings estimate revision  but it was a big one  The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate moved from  2 60 to  3 05 and the 2018 number kicked higher to  3 27 from  2 90 

Four  2 s

Lennar   NYSE         just reported good earnings so there is a chance that this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  could see estimates move even higher and that would help to push the Zacks Rank up to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  

	LEN is joined by KB Home  NYSE           Lyon William Homes  NYSE          and M D C  Holdings  NYSE          as Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stocks from this industry 

One More Report

	About a week from today we have KB Home reporting earnings  The company is slated to share the May 2017 quarter on June 27 after the close  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for revenue of  922M and EPS of  0 26 

	The previous quarter was a beat of  0 01 and a 2  positive revenue surprise and that helped push the stock higher by 2 6  in the session following the release 

	KBH has a 13 9x forward multiple which is basically in line with the industry average of 13 4x  The 1 1x book multiple is just slightly below the 1 7x industry average  The 0 5x sales multiple is also below the 0 8x industry average 

Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside  

	Today s investment ideas are short term  directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator  In addition  I invite you to consider our long term opportunities  These rare trades look to start fast with strong Zacks Ranks  but carry through with double and triple digit profit potential  Starting now  you can look inside our home run  value  and stocks under  10 portfolios  plus more 



Zacks  2017 IPO Watch List

	Before looking into the stocks mentioned above  you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks  radar  Imagine being in the first wave of investors to jump on a company with almost unlimited growth potential  This Special Report gives you the current scoop on 5 that may go public at any time 

	One has driven from 0 to a  68 billion valuation in 8 years  Four others are a little less obvious but already show jaw dropping growth

402250,TSN,Tyson Foods  Focus On Protein Brands Helps Propel Stock,opinion,"Shares of meat processor Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN    which have declined around 2 0  in the past one year  have been rising higher since past one month  During the said time period  Tyson Foods  shares have jumped 4 8   outperforming both the Zacks categorized  industry and the broader  sector 
While the industry grew just 1 1   the broader sector increased 1 0   We believe the company s efforts to expand protein packed products and offer nutritious products to health conscious consumers have been driving the stock lately 

Let s peep into the factors driving the stock 
Focus on Protein Packed Brands
The acquisition of AdvancePierre  completed on Jun 8   divestment of non protein businesses  Sara Lee Frozen Bakery  Kettle and Van s   and focus on growth categories and channels are in line with the company s strategy to expand its protein packed brands  Further  the acquisition will enable Tyson Foods to grow in the fastest growing portfolio of protein packed brands and expand its fresh prepared foods offering for both out of home and in home eating occasions 
Of late  consumers are shifting away from high priced beef and processed foods  Meanwhile  chicken nuggets  chicken sandwiches  wings  meatball sandwiches and bone in chicken have been witnessing higher growth  which shows that consumers are increasingly becoming health conscious and opting for chicken instead of red meat 
Tyson Foods seems to be well equipped with the categories that are currently in high demand at the national foodservice chains  Further  the company is set to make significant investments to improve the supply network within the food service channel 
Introducing Nutritious Breakfasts
Tyson Foods continuously innovates and adds products to an already rich food line up  As an increasing number of health conscious U S  consumers are focusing on nutritious breakfasts  Tyson Foods considers it a high potential category  Recent launches like Jimmy Dean Frittatas and Stuffed Hash Browns  Tyson FoodService Fully Cooked Drumsticks  and Buffalo Chicken Crispitos are getting good response from consumers 
In addition  the company remains on schedule to transition all of Tyson Foods retail branded chicken production to No Antibiotics Ever by June end  The company will also be launching organic chicken under its 100  antibiotic free NatureRaised Farms brand in July  Moreover  the company is striving to eliminate the use of human antibiotics from its U S  broiler chicken flocks by the end of Sep 2017 
Focusing on Meat Substitutes
Tyson Foods is foraying into meat substitutes as per the growing demand of the category  The company set up a venture capital fund worth  150 million to invest in companies that develop meat substitutes  The company also bought a 5  stake in a plant based protein producer  Beyond Meat Tyson Foods  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Bottom Line
Though we note that sluggishness in beef segment and increasing costs of prepared foods business have been denting the company s profits since past many quarters  we remain optimistic about Tyson Foods  efforts to aid boost profits  going ahead 
Tyson Foods currently holds Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Stocks to Consider
Investors interested in food stocks in the industry can consider SunOpta  Inc    NASDAQ STKL    Aramark   NYSE ARMK   and B G Foods  Inc    NYSE BGS   as valuable picks 
SunOpta has long term earnings growth rate of 15 00  and sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
Aramark and B G  both carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   have growth rates of 12 00  and 10 0   respectively

362643,WELL,Low Cost Funds Dupe Investors  3Q12,opinion,Fund holdings affect fund performance more than fees or past performance  A cheap fund is not necessarily a good fund  A fund that has done well in the past is not likely to do well in the future  e g  5 star kiss of death and active management has long history of underperformance   Yet  traditional fund research focuses only on low fees and past performance   Our research on holdings enables investors to find funds with high quality holdings   AND   low fees   Investors are good at picking cheap funds  We want them to be better at picking funds with good stocks  Both are required to maximize success   Figure 1 shows that 55  of fund assets are in ETFs and mutual funds with low costs but only 6  of assets are in ETFs and mutual funds with Attractive holdings  This discrepancy is astounding   Figure 1  Allocation of Fund Assets By Holdings Quality and By Costs Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Two key shortcomings in the ETF and mutual fund industry cause this large discrepancy A lack of research into the quality of holdings Not enough research focuses on the quality of Portfolio Management of fundsA lack of high quality holdings or good stocks With about twice as many funds as stocks in the market  there simply are not enough good stocks to fill all the funds These issues are related  in my opinion  If investors had more insight into the quality of funds  holdings  I think they would allocate a lot less money to funds with poor quality holdings  Investors deserve research on the quality of stocks held by ETFs and mutual funds  Quality of holdings is the single most important factor in determining an ETF or mutual fund s future performance  No matter how low the costs  if the ETF or mutual fund holds bad stocks  performance will be poor  Costs are easy to find but research on the quality of holdings is almost non existent  Figure 2 shows investors are not putting enough money into ETFs and mutual funds with high quality holdings  Only 590 of 7278  6  of assets  of ETFs and mutual funds allocate a significant amount of value to quality holdings  94  of assets are in funds that do not justify their costs and over charge investors for poor portfolio management  Figure 2  Distribution of ETFs   Mutual Funds  Count   Assets  By Portfolio Management Rating  Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  Figure 3 shows that Investors successfully find low cost funds  55  of assets are held in ETFs and mutual funds that have Attractive or better rated Total Annual Costs  my apples to apples measure of the all in cost of investing in any given fund   Out of the 7 278 ETFs and mutual funds I cover  1 197  55  of all assets  earn an Attractive or better Total Annual Costs rating   Clearly  ETF and mutual funds investors are smart shoppers when it comes to finding cheap investments  But cheap is not necessarily good   Fidelity Salem Street Trust  Spartan Real Estate Index Fund  FSRNX  is one of many funds with low costs but a Very Dangerous Portfolio Management rating  It gets an overall predictive rating of Very Dangerous because no matter how low its fees  I expect it to underperform because it holds too many Dangerous or worse rated stocks  Low fees cannot boost fund performance  Only good stocks can boost performance   One of the Dangerous or worse rated stocks held by FSRNX is Health Care REIT  Inc   HCN   to which it allocates over 3  of its value  The company has misleading earnings  dismal returns on invested capital  ROIC   negative cash flow  and an expensive valuation  To justify its current valuation    60 75   HCN must grow after tax profits  NOPAT  at 13  compounded annually for 36 years  HCN s poor past performance and high expectations offers investors a poor risk reward trade off   Out of the 79 stocks held by FSRNX  none earn my Attractive rating  One has to wonder how the manager failed to pick at least one good stock   Figure 3  Distribution of ETFs   Mutual Funds  Count   Assets  By Total Annual Costs Ratings  Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  Investors should allocate their capital to funds with both high quality holdings and low costs because those are the funds that offer investors the best performance potential   But they do not  Not even close   Figure 4 shows that 5  of ETF and mutual fund assets are allocated to funds with low costs and high quality holdings according to my Predictive Fund Ratings  which are based on the quality of holdings and the all in costs to investors   Note the fund industry offers 2 882 Dangerous or worse ETFs and mutual funds compared to just 245 Attractive or better ETFs and mutual funds  nearly 12 times more bad funds than good funds  That means a lot of fees are being paid to managers that do not deserve them   Figure 4  Distribution of ETFs   Mutual Funds  Count   Assets  By Predictive Ratings  Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Investors deserve forward looking ETF and mutual fund research that assesses both costs and quality of holdings  For example  Manning   Napier Fund  Inc    Dividend Focus Series  MDFSX  is a fund with both low costs and an Attractive Portfolio Management rating  Two of the good stocks held by MDFSX are Exxon Mobil Corp  XOM  and Bristol Myers Squibb Company  BMY   Both stocks earn my Very Attractive rating  They have positive or rising economic earnings  high ROICs and cheap valuations  XOM s current stock price    82 share  implies profits will permanently decline by 37  when our model shows rising economic earnings in 2011  BMY s current stock price    36 share  implies the company s NOPAT will permanently decline by 40   Both of these stocks offer Attractive risk reward because the expectations in their valuations are low and their economic earnings are strong Why is the most popular fund rating system based on backward looking past performance I do not know  but I do know that the lack of transparency into the quality of portfolio management provides cover for the ETF and mutual fund industry to continue to over charge investors for poor portfolio management  How else could they get away with selling nearly 12 times more Dangerous or worse ETFs and mutual funds than Attractive or better John Bogle is correct   investors should not pay high fees for active portfolio management  His index funds have provided investors with many low cost alternatives to actively managed funds However  by focusing entirely on costs  he overlooks the primary driver of fund performance  the stocks held by funds Research on the quality of portfolio management of funds empower empowers investors to make better investment decisions  Investors should no longer pay for poor portfolio management Disclosure  I own XOM  I receive no compensation to write about any specific stock  sector or theme ,2012-07-22,David

348359,FLR,Fluor Corp   FLR  Poised To Beat Q1 Earnings  Here s Why,opinion,"Fluor Corporation   NYSE FLR   is set to report first quarter 2016 results  after the closing bell on May 5 
The company has had a disappointing earnings history registering positive earnings surprise in just one out of the last four quarters  resulting in a negative average surprise of 6 6  

In spite of the lackluster earnings history  we expect Flour to beat estimates in the to be reported quarter 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Fluor is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP  The   which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  2 33   This is a very meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Fluor carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates  Meanwhile  Sell rated stocks   4 and  5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
The combination of Fluor s Zacks Rank  3 and ESP of  2 33  makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming report 
Growth Factors This Past Quarter
Fluor  a well managed company with a proven business model  happens to derive much of its strength from its impressive market diversity that helps it mitigate serious cyclicality of markets in which it operates  This apart  the company s strong financial health  diligent restructuring initiatives and strong foothold in the U S  engineering and construction sector are expected to be conducive to first quarter 2016 results 
The recent uptick in the activities of oil   gas customers of the company has provided the much needed momentum to the company s LNG business which is expected to boost top and bottom line performance in the to be reported quarter  This apart  Fluor has largely pursued strategic alliances in the past to boost its market share and inorganic revenue growth  In this regard  the recently completed buyout of Dutch engineering and construction company Stork Holding B V has piqued investors  interest as this is expected to boost the company s Global Services sales 
Moreover  Fluor s solid track record of winning awards has proved to be a major driver of revenues and margins  Also  the company s strong backlog levels hint at the continuation of this trend in the first quarter as well  Some of the noteworthy contracts clinched by Fluor led joint ventures during the first quarter of 2016 include a design build and project maintenance deal from Arizona Department of Transportation  ADOT  and design build  finance  operate and maintenance award from Maryland Department of Transportation and Maryland Transit Administration for the Purple Line project 
Also  Fluor s industry leading position in the nuclear remediation at government facilities throughout the U S  is expected to pose a major tailwind to its first quarter 2016 performance  During the first quarter of 2016  the company was also selected by the U S  Department of Energy  DOE  to support cleanup mission initiatives at the Idaho Site under the Idaho Cleanup Project  ICP  Core Contract  The long term contract spanning over a period of five years is valued at  1 4 billion  Moreover  nuclear project wins from Westinghouse earlier this year and an uptick in transportation spending in the U S  over the past few months are expected to propel growth in the to be reported quarter   
Despite these potent growth drivers  lower commodity prices and the subsequent uncertainty in consumer spending along with strengthening of the U S  dollar raise caution

254251,SNA,Snap On  SNA  To Report Q1 Earnings  A Beat In The Cards ,opinion,"Snap on Incorporated   NYSE SNA   is scheduled to report first quarter 2017 results  before the opening bell on Apr 20 
Snap on has an outstanding earnings surprise history   it has not missed estimates in over seven years  Last quarter  it registered a positive earnings surprise of 2 5  and has an average positive surprise of 4  for the trailing four quarters

Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Snap on has the right combination of the two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP  The  for Snap on is  1 28  as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at  2 37  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at  2 34  This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Snap on carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings 
The combination of Snap on s Zacks Rank  3 and ESP of  1 28  makes us confident of an earnings beat   
We only caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions 
What s Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings 
Snap on s successful earnings streak reflects its consistent capability to leverage on market opportunities for augmenting growth  The company continues to make significant efforts toward improving its operating efficiency through the Snap on Value Creation Processes  For instance  during Q4 2016  Snap on s value creation process contributed to the 3 6  organic sales growth  operating margin of 19 8  and an11 3  increase in earnings per share 
Encouragingly  the company has been witnessing encouraging prospects in most of its business lines that signal brighter days  going forward  Additionally  Snap on s financial services portfolio has been recording steady growth over the past few years 
Snap On Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   In order to further boost growth  the company recently purchased the Sweden based firm   Car O Liner   for  155 million  Snap On believes that this buyout will strengthen its Repair Systems   Information Group position  thus allowing it to fortify its footprint in the auto and heavy duty markets 
Snap on also acquired torque wrench marker   Sturtevant Richmont   which is engaged in the designing  manufacturing and distributing of mechanical  and electronic torque wrenches  Snap on believes that this strategic buyout will improve its critical mechanical performance by addressing critical torque requirements 
Additionally  Tools Group and Repair Systems   Information segments are anticipated to act as major profit churners on the back of positive industry trends  While factors like rising penetration in emerging markets  and constant software and hardware upgrades have been fuelling Tools Group s growth  Repair Systems has been gaining from business deals with independent repair shop owners and managers  Further  Snap On s flourishing financial services portfolio will likely act as a catalyst for the quarter to be reported

381031,AMZN,All grown up and nowhere to work  Berlin runs short of office space,news,"By Caroline Copley BERLIN  Reuters    Nearly 30 years after the fall of the Wall   cool  Berlin is booming  with some 40 000 people moving to the German capital every year to work not just at its vibrant tech start ups but also increasingly at big multinational firms  As the city once seen as a low cost government backwater comes into its own as a European business center  office supply has not been able to keep up with the sharp rise in demand    Berlin has come out of its pre pubescent phase and is now becoming more grown up in a way that other big cities maybe already have done   said Stefan Franzke  CEO of Berlin Partner  which promotes investment in the city and helps companies open offices  Building activity is up 90 percent compared to a year ago with around 557 000 sq meters currently under construction  according to  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  Real Estate  This won t bring much relief in the short term  however  as only around one quarter of that will be completed over the next 12 months and the majority has already been pre let  Average office rents in Berlin are now the highest in Germany   although premium office space in Frankfurt is still the most expensive   and vacancy rates are under 2 percent  down from nearly 7 8 percent in 2010   The shortage is challenging both businesses and landlords to be open minded about how to define office space and how to keep down costs  Operators of coworking real estate are playing a big role pushing up rents  gobbling up around 71 000 sq meters of new office space last year  about 8 percent of the total take up  WeWork now has five offices in Berlin and plans to open another location early next year and a further site in summer 2019  But coworking space is not just for start ups anymore  Deutsche Bahn has rented space at one WeWork office and will take over eight floors of another WeWork building in the autumn  The arrangement helps the train operator meet growing demand for desks in the short term as it hires employees to work on digital projects and facilitates networking with start ups  a spokeswoman said  Amazon  O AMZN  has several office buildings in Berlin s central Mitte district  but also rents temporary and coworking spaces to accommodate the rapid growth of its Berlin based staff  now numbering more than 2 300   It s hyper competitive   said Eva Glanzer  vice president of People  at online travel booking firm GetYourGuide  which has just secured space for a new headquarters after a two year search left its 350 employees running between meetings at several different locations across the city  While some start ups have moved out of Berlin s central districts  CEO Michael von Roeder of Sensorberg  which kits out buildings with digital technology  says he will struggle to keep talent if he ups sticks to the suburbs   In the past  if you spent enough money it was fairly easy to find space   von Roeder said   In the meantime  even if you don t care what you pay it s still difficult   Sensorberg has temporarily crammed its 30 employees into an office with another firm while it waits for a new co working facility  It has also found an innovative solution to the rising costs by securing discounted space in the new space by agreeing to provide its own technology   The competition is heightened by the fact that landlords aren t used to working with the new generation of high growth startups like us  They re old fashioned  they prefer stability  and they want to see the numbers   said Glanzer  CHANGING SPACES Prime office rents spiked by 16 percent in the year to the end of March to 33 euros per square meter compared to 22 euros in 2013  says BNP Paribas   far above what most start ups can afford to pay  This means Berlin  a city of 3 7 million people  is narrowing the gap on Germany s bigger business centers  Frankfurt and Munich  which can command 42 and 37 euros per sq meter per month  respectively  for top locations  Frankfurt has a population of 740 000 people while Munich is home to 1 5 million  The rising rents are incentivising some owners of other types of property to refit their buildings and wheel in desks  Around 25 000 square meters of hotel space in Berlin s Mitte and Charlottenberg districts are being converted into offices  according to Jan Niklas Schroers at real estate firm Savills  It s a tiny fraction of total hotel space  demand for which continues to grow with around 6 500 rooms in the pipeline  according to PwC  However  for landlords who may have rented out their buildings to hotels 10 years ago  they can expect an increase in rental income of between 30 and 50 percent if they turn it into office space  especially in good locations  said Schroers  Austrian real estate group Signa is converting one of the former East Germany s flagship department stores into a futuristic office and retail complex   Daimler   DE DAIGn  has signed a rental contract to take over an imposing Jugendstil building that was built as a department store at the turn of the 20th century  In Mitte  residents of two nursing homes operated by family firm Berthold Hecht  will have to move out by the end of next May to make way for offices  Developers used to have to prove they had rental contracts for buildings before they could even get financing  Now banks are handing out credit without firms having to do any marketing  said Berlin Partner s Franzke  Completed construction is expected to tick up in 2019 and 2020 and plenty of space remains to be developed in the wasteland where the Wall once stood  But Berlin needs to plan ahead for what kind of city it wants to become  cautioned Savills  Schroers  
 Capital follows talent and at the moment the talent is here because Berlin is cheap and cool   he said   If it loses some of that mojo and becomes less affordable the talent might go somewhere else  ",2018-06-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/all-grown-up-and-nowhere-to-work-berlin-runs-short-of-office-space-1504985,1504985

However  Saudi Arabia and Russia have said cuts could be eased after receiving calls from consumers including the United States  China and India to support global demand 
Meanwhile  oil traders will also continue to weigh a steady increase in U S  production levels in the coming week as the rise in domestic drilling has been underscoring worries about rising U S  output 
U S  drillers added one oil rig last week  bringing the total count to 862  the highest number since March 2015   General Electric   NYSE GE  s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday 
Domestic oil production   driven by shale extraction   is currently at an all time high of 10 8 million bpd  Only Russia currently produces more  at around 11 million bpd 
Fresh weekly data on U S  commercial crude inventories on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world s largest oil consumer and how fast output levels will continue to rise will capture the market s attention 
Crude oil futures finished slightly lower on Friday and registered a marginal decline for the week 
U S  benchmark oil  West Texas Intermediate WTI crude lost 21 cents  or 0 3   to settle at  65 74 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  with the commodity logging a weekly loss of 0 1   That marked the third weekly decline in a row 
Elsewhere  Brent crude  the global benchmark  shed 86 cents  or 1 1   to end at  76 46 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange  finishing down 0 4  for the week  Brent has posted weekly drops in two of the past three weeks 
Meanwhile  Brent s premium over WTI futures remained near three year highs above  11 a barrel  The premium has doubled in less than a month  as surging U S  production and a lack of pipeline capacity has trapped a lot of output inland 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the main events likely to affect the oil market 
Tuesday  June 12
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties will publish its monthly assessment of oil markets 
The American Petroleum Institute is to publish its weekly report on U S  oil supplies

345239,BIG,Big Lots  BIG  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Big Lots  NYSE BIG  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Big Lots basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Big Lots  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Big Lots
For the fiscal year ending January   2020  this discount retailer is expected to earn  3 81 per share  which is a change of  5 7  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Big Lots  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Big Lots to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-lots-big-moves-to-buy-rationale-behind-the-upgrade-200503329,200503329

322091,WPM,The Inverted Yield Curve Is A Good Sign For Stocks,opinion,"August 14 was the worst day of the year for stocks 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 800 points in a single day 
The stock market plunged because of a serious economic warning sign called a yield curve inversion 
A yield curve inversion is a canary in the coal mine for the economy  It s happened before every recession in the last 50 years 
However  there s no reason to panic 
An inverted yield curve does not mean a recession is imminent  In fact  the last five times the yield curve inverted  stocks actually rose for the next 12 18 months 
Why This Inversion Spooked Investors So Much
When investors talk about the yield curve  they re talking about the difference between long term Treasury yields and short term Treasury yields 
Normally  investors demand higher yields for longer term bonds  So the yield curve normally slopes upward like this 




But sometimes  things aren t so normal 
When one of the long term Treasuries yields less than one of the short term Treasuries  it s called a yield curve inversion 

For example  that might mean the yield on 10 year Treasuries is less than the yield on 3 month Treasuries  like it was back in March 

Or it might mean the yield on 10 year Treasuries is less than the yield on 2 year Treasuries 
That s what happened on August 14  The 10 year yield was 1 59   and the 2 year yield was 1 60   So  the difference was  0 01    Whenever this number is negative  you ve got a yield curve inversion  
The last time this part of the yield curve inverted was in December 2005 two years before the financial crisis 
So it s pretty rare  That s why the August 14 inversion spooked investors so much and US stocks suffered their worst day of the year 
A Recession Is Coming  but Not Tomorrow
There s no way around it  The August 14 inversion means investors expect the economy to slow soon 
Remember  the yield curve has inverted before every recession over the past 50 years 
You can see the inversion shortly before the last three recessions in the next chart   Yield curve inversions are circled in red  and recessions are highlighted in grey  




But here s the thing  Those recessions weren t immediate  They happened 12 months later  on average 
In other words  we re probably headed for a recession  but not tomorrow 
The same logic applies to the stock market 
Stocks Could Continue to Climb Until September 2020

The recent yield curve inversion is a positive sign for stocks  at least for now  That s because the S P 500 rose significantly after the last three inversions 
You can see this in the table below 




In the 12 months after the last three inversions  the S P 500 returned an average of 18 7   Those are major gains equal to the return on the S P 500 since June 2017 
If the pattern holds  stocks should continue to rise until about September 2020 
This Isn t the Time for More Risk
History says the stock market should perform well for the next 12 months  But 12 months can go by quickly 
At this point  buying risky stocks is like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller  You might make solid gains at first  then get squashed and lose a big chunk of money 
Most investors take on too much risk anyway  even in normal market conditions  But with the stock market near all time highs and the recent yield curve inversion  this is truer than ever 
That s why  if you buy anything  you want to buy safe and reliable dividend paying stocks 

That means gold royalty companies like Wheaton Precious Metals  NYSE WPM  
Investors buy gold when stock market risk rises  So when stocks eventually do hit the skids  gold and gold linked companies like Wheaton will benefit 
We saw this at the end of last year  When the S P 500 fell 15  from September to December  Wheaton Precious Metals rose 23  

It also means companies like Walmart  NYSE WMT  
The company has a growing stronghold in the surging e commerce market  and its stock is safe  Case in point  when the S P 500 fell 20  at the end of 2018  Walmart s share price actually increased 
That s exactly the type of company you want to own right now 

Last on my list is CME Group  NASDAQ CME  
CME operates the largest futures exchange in the world  Investors buy futures contracts to bet on whether the price of something will rise or fall  When stock prices go up and down a lot  CME sells even more contracts 
In other words  the company actually benefits from a more volatile stock market 
If history is any guide  stocks should continue to climb for the next 12 months or so  Still  whether it comes 6  12  or 24 months from now  you want to prepare your portfolio for a pullback now 
That means steering clear of risky  overpriced stocks and adding safe and reliable dividend payers like the three I just mentioned ",2019-09-03,Robert Ross,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-inverted-yield-curve-is-a-good-sign-for-stocks-200461028,200461028

302094,MSFT,The Expansionary Fiscal Contraction That Worked,opinion,Despite the International Monetary Fund World Bank Spring Meetings  as well as a G20 get together  the biggest economic news of the past two weeks was the mistake in an influential economic study  The study is of course the Reinhart Rogoff  R 2  paper  I am sure most Economonitor readers are familiar with the matter at hand  as it has been a trending topic in Economonitor for the past few days  But for those of you who just landed from a Mars mission   and are unaware of what s going on  I provided a short summary  with a few useful hyperlinks  on the issue in the column  If that is not sufficient    Most of the articles posted at Economonitor and others in the media blogosphere are harshly criticizing the paper  I love to be contrarian  and so the second part of the paper is devoted to a successful case of expansionary fiscal contraction  Turkey during 2003 2005  This way  I may help R 2 to get back on their feet  Not that they need my help  The duo are respected international macroeconomists  Rogoff was the IMF s chief economist from 2001 to 2003  But when they published the paper  R R were famous because of their recent book  This Time Is Different  Eight Centuries of Financial Folly  highly recommended   Besides  they just  defending their paper in the New York Times  along with a   I am not kidding  this is how they described it   this has to a first   so they don t need my help at all    Anyway  I read both of their columns carefully  I agree with some of their points  not others  but I am not going to spend the next 10 000 words boring you with my views on their points  I am sure someone else more qualified than me  probably Paul KrugTron  defender of the Keynesian universe  will do that  especially since his home home planet New York Times was attacked by the  Reinhart and Rogoff  Edit  I just checked his NYT blog and saw that  Instead  I would like to raise a more general point  As I mention in the column  R 2 do not argue that there is a causal relationship between debt and growth  they couldn t do that with the descriptive statistics in the paper anyway  There have been earlier papers  most notably one by Harvard University s Alberto Alesina and Slivia Ardagna  who have argued for a causal relationship  and got their share of criticism  from the IMF and others and more recently from    But austerity proponents chose to deduce causality from the R 2 paper because it was in their interest to do so  As I mentioned above  R 2 were already famous because of their book  and so they were turned into reluctant heroes of the austerity movement  What do I make of all this  Simply put  as Ugo Panizza and Andrea F Presbitero    The debt growth link is more complex than commonly thought  While there is evidence that public debt is negatively correlated with economic growth  there is no study that makes a strong case for a causal relationship going from debt to growth    And if you want to make the counter argument with a somewhat compelling case against fiscal stimulus  Matthew Yglesias   This has indeed been a long introduction  As for an addendum  I would like to start by noting that you should not make too much of the Turkish result  After all  as I mentioned int the column as well  the previous fiscal consolidation efforts in 1994 1995 and 2000 were unsuccessful  Before writing the column  I did a bit of research and stumbled upon  and concluded that fiscal contractions are in general not expansionary in Turkey  It is not in a refereed journal  and I did not have a chance to read it  so I would not take the result as iron clad at this stage  but for now  I would see the Turkish 2003 2005 episode as the exception rather than the rule  So that brings us to the next question  What makes a fiscal consolidation successful  My short answer is I don t know  I think research is lacking in this area  IMHO  it seems a few fiscal contractions work  while most end up with the usual Keynesian effect  Therefore  other than discussing whether fiscal contractions can be expansionary or not  research should focus on the conditions that make fiscal consolidations expansionary  As I mentioned in the column  I see the bank balance sheet clean up as the key aspect of the 2003 2005 Turkish consolidation  The 2000 episode had a problematic real exchange appreciation  and rather than clean up the banks  the 1994 1995 episode sowed the seeds of banking problems that led to the 2001 crisis  As you can see  even for a particular country  each successful or unsuccessful fiscal contraction has certain specifics that caused that effort to succeed or fail  So I am not sure if much could be gained from regression analysis  but I am just your average econ  columnist  it is up to real academics to tackle this issue  The next question is whether the debate of the last few weeks will put an end to austerity  Capital Economics does not think so  In a short note they published yesterday  they argue that  fiscal austerity will be a major drag on growth for some years to come  particularly in advance economies   The IMF s latest numbers show that advanced G20 countries are planning to tighten fiscal policy by a total of 2 7  of GDP over the three year period from 2013 to 2015  following significant tightening during the previous two years  What s more  as the IMF acknowledged in its October World Economic Outlook  in current conditions the impact of this austerity on growth may be much larger than was previously supposed  Although most countries are tightening fiscal policy  the scale of the squeeze varies considerably  The biggest contraction this year is likely to be in the US  largely because of the impact of the automatic  sequester  which came into effect on 1st March  At the other end of the spectrum  Germany should escape austerity more or less completely  In the euro zone as a whole  however  austerity will continue for some time yet and we think policymakers have underestimated its impact on the economy  I don t want to delve too much into the debate itself  there are so many columns posts arguments counterarguments that I would not know where to start  Instead  I would like to touch upon a more general point  What does this debate tell about the future of economics  Mark Thoma   but KrugTron asserts  on the other hand  that   No good story should be perfect without a good drama  In this case  while everyone is discussing the idea  some have opted to bring forward the man behind the idea   who found the error in R R s Excel sheet  While his story is quite interesting  so is   at  UMass Amherst has long been known as the bastion of leftist economics  you may want to use the term unorthodox heterodox if you want to be more P C    In fact  well known  at least in Turkey  leftist Turkish   formerly of Bilkent University  currently at Yasar University in Izmir  has close relations with them and has been a visiting professor there a couple of times  if I m not mistaken  BTW  hopefully  my HDN column and this post rose your interest in the Turkish 2001 crisis and 2003 2005 fiscal consolidation  I could hardly do full justice to the program in a couple of paragraphs  and I know of a study by Fatih Ozatay and Guven Sak on the 2001 crisis  While I did find their paper  I also stumbled upon another paper by Ozatay on the 2003 2005 Turkish fiscal consolidation  He makes more or less the same points as in my column  There is a longer more detailed version of the paper as well  And I even found   but I have not tried to get a hold of it  Shifting gears a bit  this column has given me a chance to let out my usual complaints lamentations about the econ  columnist profession in Turkey  Although the R 2 debate was by far the leading economic agenda of the past 10 days or so  I saw very few columns on it in Turkish papers  A notable exception was my preferred daily Radikal  Their columnists  and  mentioned the issue early on  both in Turkish   and Fatih Ozatay  the author of the Turkish fiscal consolidation paper I mentioned above  also writes there  so we maybe he ll have something in the next couple of days  This lack of interest reflects  IMHO  that most Turkish columnists are not following global developments well  After all  for any Turkish economist  or anyone moderately familiar with the Turkish economy  the first thing that comes to mind when hearing about the R 2 debate should be the Turkish 2003 2005 fiscal consolidation  Finally  I would like to conclude with a little bit of humor  Apparently  this is not the first time Excel has wrecked havoc on the economy  it may even be  FT Alphaville takes the joke seriously and argues that this is a gross exaggeration ,2013-04-28,Emre Deliveli,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-expansionary-fiscal-contraction-that-worked-164765,164765

from the prior year figure of  1 055 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at  867 8 million The company s robust underlying sales performance can be attributed to persistent momentum in its focus categories and strength in Jack Daniel s  Woodford Reserve  Old Forester and Herradura brand families  Further  net sales gained from improved economies in the emerging markets Brown Forman

administrative  SG A  expenses remained flat from the year ago quarter at  163 million  while on an underlying basis it declined 1   This was primarily backed by stringent cost controls However  advertising expenses rose 4  year over year to  111 million  while underlying advertising costs increased 3   The rise in advertising costs can be attributed to rise in investments for the Jack

projects 6 7  growth in underlying sales  Earlier  the company had forecasted underlying sales growth of 4 5  Nevertheless  the company expects the positive operating leverage experienced in the first half to reverse in the second half  The reversal will stem from higher cost of sales and increased operating investments in the second half mainly related to the favorable environment for the company

261109,BAC,Financial Services Firms Eye Blockchain For Industry Transformation ,opinion,"Global financial services firms  like so many other industries right now  might just be on the cusp of massive disruption via blockchain and the digital currencies including Bitcoin  Ethereum and Ripple that rely on that technology  Indeed  we re at a moment currently where it appears financial services firms have one of two immediate options  evolve or die 
Though the development and adoption of blockchain technology is still in the early stages of implementation within the financial services sector  that doesn t mean savvy companies aren t working on solutions for a successful evolution  Survival notwithstanding  the  smart money  understands that this technology has the potential to revolutionize the sector 
Blockchain technology acts as a decentralized ledger  recording each piece of data simultaneously across all nodes on its network  Information cannot be erased  which means the blockchain will hold a record of every transaction ever made  Ratings agency Moody s  that blockchain will transform and disrupt myriad industries 
Undoubtedly  blockchain poses a potential long term competitive threat to a variety of business sectors  but the focus of this post will remain squarely within the financial sector  So what exactly are major financial services companies doing to harness the power of blockchain 
Financial Clearing Houses and Blockchain 
Clearing houses play an important role in the financial community  acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers of financial instruments  They re responsible for settling and clearing trades and reporting trading data 
One of the most popular clearing houses as well as one of the largest global financial services corporations is New York City based Depository Trust   Clearing Corporation  DTCC   In early January 2017  a collaboration with IBM  NYSE IBM   Axoni  a capital markets focused tech firm  and R3 a distributed database tech company  to  replatform DTCC s Trade Information Warehouse  by building a distributed ledger technology  DLT  framework to drive further improvements in derivatives post trade lifecycle events  This is a positive move toward blockchain implementation 
The CEO of DTCC  Mike Bodson   he believes  it s too early for technologies like DLT to be of much use   In an interview with Trak in he claimed that many of the Distributed Ledger Solution providers are  in fact  working alongside organizations like DTCC to manage these solutions  Other major corporations reportedly experimenting with DLT inlcude the financial sector s Citibank  NYSE C   as well as companies such as Intel  NASDAQ INTC  
Banks Adopting Blockchain 
Blockchain continues to gain popularity with commercial banks and other institutions within the payments sector  UBS  NYSE UBS   Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB   Santander  NYSE SAN   as well as BNY Mellon  NYSE BK   on a utility settlement coin  USC  with the aim of creating a digital currency for use in financial markets  The goal would be to  for inter bank settlements and replace middle men who operate between buyers and sellers  A number of global banks recently joined the initiative including Barclays  LON BARC   HSBC Holdings  NYSE HSBC   State Street  NYSE STT  and Credit Suisse  NYSE CS  
UBS has been leading this project since 2015  During September of that year they launched their first USC concept in collaboration with UK based blockchain company Clearmatics 
R3  one of the companies working with clearing house DTCC  above  has also  from financial sector heavyweights including Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   ING Group  NYSE ING  and Bank of America  NYSE BAC   as well as Intel  to develop their Corda Platform  another way to record and manage financial transactions between regulated institutions 
Private Equity Management Eyeing Blockchain Too
Multinational professional services firm Ernst   Young  EY   and one of the  big four  accounting firms  has been considering the application of blockchain technology to wealth and asset management  Angus Champion de Crespigny  EY s Financial Services Blockchain Strategy leader  points out that over the past few of years  private equity management firms have been  blockchain technology for ways in which it could help their clients 

 More recently however we have started to see greater interest in cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets and our clients seeking viewpoints on how they may change the PE landscape  While there has been interest  the PE sector has been approaching with caution and there has been less spend than we have seen in other areas of asset management   

Still  though there appears to be a lot of blockchain related activity within the financial sector  it s still early days  Blockstack co founder Muneeb Ali stressed in a recent tweet that there s still lots to be done and plenty of opportunity for innovation ",2018-03-13,Tanzeel Akhtar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/financial-services-firms-200297505,200297505

this week  The euro got no help from remarks by ECB President Mario Draghi on Wednesday that that the ECB s monetary policy would remain loose  In the US  Final GDP fell well below expectations  On Thursday  the markets were treated to some positive news as German Unemployment Change dropped sharply  Italian 10 year bonds continue to rise  and posted an average yield of 4 55  in the Thursday auction  In the US  there are two key releases later today   Unemployment Claims and Pending Home Sales The markets got a look at US GDP numbers on Wednesday  and the results were less than impressive  Final GDP did rise nicely  from 0 4  to 1 8   but this was well short of the estimate of 2 4   The Final GDP Price Index rose 1 2   edging past the estimate of 1 1   The weak GDP release put a damper on a bright market mood thanks to excellent US numbers on Tuesday  Core Durable Goods  CB Consumer Confidence and New Home Sales  all key releases  beat their estimates  Manufacturing data  often a sore spot  also looked good as the Richmond Manufacturing Index had its best performance since last November  The strong numbers are particularly encouraging as they come from a wide range of economic sectors Is the US Federal Reserve backtracking on QE  The US dollar surged last week after Federal Reserve Chair Bernard Bernanke said that the Fed was planning to scale down QE  However  US  and global  stock markets fell sharply on the news  and the Fed finds itself trying to contain the damage and calm the nervous markets  Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher declared that  tapering  should not be confused with  tightening  and said that the Fed was not exiting from its accommodative policy action just yet  Minneapolis Fed President Naraya Kocherlakota reiterated that the Fed was continuing with an expansionary monetary policy event if QE was terminated  and said that it was a misperception to assume that the Federal Reserve had turned more hawkish  One can be excused for dismissing these statements as little more than linguistic acrobatics  and it is questionable if the markets will be reassured by these statements from the Fed  which are clearly aimed at damage control and reassuring nervous investors Germany has long been considered the locomotive of Europe  but the largest economy in Europe is having trouble  although it is in much better shape than the other major economies in the Eurozone  The week got off to a slow start  as German Ifo Business Climate  a key indicator  came in slightly below the estimate  However  there was better news as German

381098,BIDU,BIDU Vs  SHOP  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Internet   Services sector have probably already heard of Baidu Inc   NASDAQ BIDU  and Shopify  SHOP   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Baidu Inc  has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Shopify has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that BIDU s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
BIDU currently has a forward P E ratio of 20 82  while SHOP has a forward P E of 522 44  We also note that BIDU has a PEG ratio of 7 53  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  SHOP currently has a PEG ratio of 22 07 
Another notable valuation metric for BIDU is its P B ratio of 1 47  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  SHOP has a P B of 16 85 
These metrics  and several others  help BIDU earn a Value grade of B  while SHOP has been given a Value grade of F 
BIDU sticks out from SHOP in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that BIDU is the better option right now ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bidu-vs-shop-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200474527,200474527

313965,GE,Picking Renewable Energy Stocks With John McIlveen,opinion,It s impossible to generalize when it comes to renewable energy investments  Therefore  investors must approach opportunities on a case by case    and state by state    basis  But Jacob Securities Senior Vice President of Research John McIlveen knows how to pick his plays in any market environment  In this interview with The Energy Report  John McIlveen names his best bets  As always  safety first The Energy Report  In your last interview  your primary concern in making investment decisions was safety  I know you focus primarily on Canadian companies  but has all the  fiscal cliff  talk influenced your approach to renewable energy investments John McIlveen  With the fiscal cliff  I could see how renewables might get pushed to the back burner in the process of cutting a budget deal  Some renewable incentive policies might even be used as a bargaining chip to get other budget items through  such as higher taxes or spending cuts TER  How have the oil and gas market dynamics in 2012 affected the outlook for companies in the renewables industry JM  Renewables are very competitive with oil fired power  but not with gas or natural gas burning plants  Gas sets the marginal price for power and affects the prices for a new project that developers are trying to build  This doesn t affect existing projects because these are all under long term contracts with fixed prices that generally include an escalation clause  But for bidding a new contract  a low gas price pinches the budget for developers TER  How much do current prices affect the timing of any new investment decisions in the renewables field JM  In those states that don t have a renewable portfolio standard    and about two thirds of the states do have one    there isn t going to be much incentive for renewable power  period  States that do have renewable portfolio standards  such as California  have to consider how they will achieve the percentage of renewable power objectives that they have  If they really want to hit their portfolio standards  they re probably going to have to pay up in terms of the power price they re willing to contract for  There s still incentive on the state level to proceed with renewable energy  But on the federal level  not so much  Most of the incentive programs  such as investment tax credit grants and or biodiesel tax credits  for example  are all expiring  TER  Are the dynamics different in Canada than in the U S  JM  Each province has its own way of going about things  Some have incentive programs  Some do not  Some have a high tariff structure  Some do not  In the U S   if natural gas is going to affect the local market in terms of new project prices and power prices  then developers may just put a project on the back burner  They would perhaps look to areas outside the U S  that may be getting power supplied by oil fired generation  such as much of the Caribbean and more remote mining sites in South America  When you re replacing the cost of oil  which in some jurisdictions is as much as  250 hour  renewables at as much as  100 hour look pretty good TER  Where do you see the best growth opportunities in renewable energy JM  Within the U S  it s more case by case or more like state by state  depending on how much they want renewable power  Probably the best growth opportunities lie more in the Caribbean and Central and South America where they don t have a natural gas supply and import oil to generate electricity  Using renewable power and cutting oil imports is great for their balance of payments and at the same time their consumers are getting a lower price for the power TER  Getting to specific companies you cover  I see that you ve raised your target price for Ram Power Corp    TSX  substantially  from  0 68 to  0 90 share  What s the story there JM  Ram Power just came on line with 36 megawatts  MW  in the last quarter and will add another 36 MW before the end of this year  I m looking for Ram to generate  40 million   40M  in EBITDA for 2013  That puts the current valuation down around four or five times enterprise value to EBITDA  But the market has to see the cash flow before it s going to give any value to it  It s looking for show me stocks for juniors  and this is not just limited to Ram Power  All the junior stocks are capital constrained  so they have difficulty raising new money to expand or to take on new projects  compared to the more mature companies that pay a dividend  which have great access to capital and a decent valuation in the market from which to raise more money Back in January  I thought safety was really the main concern  and that situation still continues today  Whereas the dividend paying  more mature power companies have done well and are mostly up on a year to date basis  almost none of the juniors are  barring a special situation such as a potential takeover  This would be the case for Shear Wind Inc    TSX V   Western Wind Energy Corp    TSX V  and Finavera Wind Energy Corp    TSX   So if you were interested in buying the junior companies  you shouldn t be buying them expecting near term growth  because they re capital constrained  If you re buying them  you re hoping they ll get taken over because their valuations are very cheap    much below what I would think they would be in the private markets We re starting to see M A activity among the juniors  whereas the seniors are still all about yield  In just the last four weeks the seniors seem to be declining somewhat  which is perhaps an indication that the market is seeing that yield stocks may have become a little bit too pricey and are starting to look for value elsewhere  This also goes for banks  real estate investment trusts and a lot of the yield stocks in general TER  In the oil and gas business it seems that almost any company that s reasonably successful gets taken out after five or six years  Is that going to be the case with most of these smaller companies in the renewables field JM  I think so  but I ll put them into two categories  There are junior companies with power plants that are on line and those without  I don t think the market is paying good money for a company with a pipeline of undeveloped assets  So if you ve got some rights to a bunch of sites that you re evaluating  but no power purchase agreement signed  you re not going to get much value for those assets  However  power assets on line  generating real cash flow  are going to be attractive to anybody larger than that company TER  One of the companies you mentioned last time was U S  Geothermal Inc      What s happened with that one since you last talked with us about it JM  U S  Geothermal has been bringing assets on line and hitting its milestones  I m looking for it to produce an EBITDA of  15M in 2013 and be cash flow positive for the first time  It has on line assets  which could make it an attractive takeover target  I would think that Ram would be pretty attractive as well  Alterra Power Corp    TSX  has had a number of events that could make it a very interesting story  It received an offer for its geothermal assets in Iceland  If this sale goes through  the company would have more than  120M cash on the books and be debt free  Alterra also has other projects with permits and power purchase agreements where it could redeploy that cash  Also  General Electric Co    NYSE  is selling some wind and hydro assets in British Columbia  two of which involve joint ventures with Alterra one hydro and one wind  If the price is attractive enough  Alterra might also sell along with GE or perhaps  if it s a passive buyer  it may want Alterra to stay and run the assets  A lot of events are working in Alterra s favor that can create cash  which it could deploy into its other development projects TER  So  Alterra could become some sort of midtier type growth company that could expand on its own  rather than being taken over immediately JM  If no one wants to take out Alterra  then it s likely that by the time a number of these events unfold in 2013  it may actually become a dividend paying company in 2014 or 2015 TER  There s been quite a bit of turmoil in the solar energy industry this year  particularly for hardware producers  How are the companies you follow in solar energy production doing JM  Hardware producers are a totally different animal than the power producers  We get a lot of calls from the press relating to government guaranteed programs  A power producer has a fixed price and a fixed quantity contract for 20 years  so it s a good bet for a loan  Manufacturing  especially in the solar chain  involves many steps  and not everyone is integrated through the whole chain  A lot of boom bust cycles occur within the equipment manufacturing industry  even for wind power  So  there just isn t the type of certainty and predictability that you have in financing a power generator TER  The wind energy production industry is also dependent a lot on government subsidies  One of the companies you discussed last time was Western Wind Energy  which has been embroiled in both internal power struggles and possible takeover deals  Where does that one stand now JM  Western Wind put itself up for sale last summer and has been allowing potential suitors into the due diligence room to look at the company  We don t know who the eventual buyer will be or the price to be paid  Over a year ago there was a soft offer from a suitor for  2 50 share  so that s where the stock is hovering  waiting for more news on the potential sale  But  a group of dissident shareholders did come forward and wanted to change the board to people they felt would be more committed to the sale of the company  The existing board beat that back in a shareholder vote and so remains in control  but at the same time they state that they are committed to selling the company  It looks good from a risk return profile because there isn t much downside to owning it at  2 50  whereas I think there could be some significant upside when the final bids are in  TER  Any projected time on when they might be accepting an offer from somebody JM  We re expecting an update soon  They ve been at it now for a good three months of due diligence and it could be another three months before a final offer is accepted TER  Have there been any interesting developments with some of the other companies that you ve been following JM   BIOX Corporation   TSX   which makes biodiesel  is suffering from a symptom of the industry as a whole  It s actually shut down its plant because of weak prices in the biodiesel market due to the expiring of the  1 gallon tax credit and the fact that the volume mandate set by the EPA is just about filled for this year  So  they lose money at the market prices today  which I m sure is the case for many biofuel producers  This is an industry that is incentive driven and needs those incentives to go forward TER  What happens with BIOX if there aren t some positive developments in its favor JM  If you re in the business you ve got to assume there will be some recovery in prices  After all  the volume mandates set by the EPA did go up by 28  for 2013  If too many plants shut down  producers can t meet the EPA volume mandates  and prices will have to go up to make those plants open up again  In the meantime  it s going to be a rough ride until the market finds that equilibrium price for biodiesel TER  Can this become a cyclical thing that s going to be on again  off again for some period of years JM  Each year  Congress allows the tax credit to expire  In 2011 they let it expire for the whole year and then reinstated it at the end of the year retroactively  This sort of incentive makes the market gyrate and something more consistent is needed for this industry  TER  On the other hand  if investors want to take a crapshoot  it s an opportunity to play a little mini cycle JM  That s right  So  if you ve got some political savvy and you think incentives are going to be restored  then that would be a good play TER  What s been going on in the senior company sector JM  There s been an interesting development of late with Just Energy Group Inc    TSX   which is basically a reseller of electricity and natural gas  along with some other activities across North America  The stock has gone down from a one year high of  14 to about  8 50 share today  resulting in a dividend yield of almost 15   I bring this up to make a point about dividends  Investors often look at the dividends in a group  whether it be banks  real estate or utilities  In the case of power producers  the low yield in the group is around 4 3  and the high yield is almost 15   That s quite a spread  but when you see a high yield  as in the case of Just Energy  it s because the market is pricing in the risk of a dividend cut So  just because you see a high yield  don t go rushing to that when you see 14  versus 6   When a company has a 6  yield in the power sector  it s likely because it s lower risk and the market thinks its dividends will increase over time  If you don t want to do a lot of homework  the simple way to pick these stocks is to pick the one with the lower dividend  because that one is probably going to increase over time  whereas a high yield may see a dividend cut  TER  Are there any other of the more established companies you d like to mention that look interesting JM  If you want to sleep well at night  you ve got to be thinking Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp     and Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners L P      which are the two largest ones in the Canadian space  Northland Power Inc    TSX  is also a premier company  which is about to double its megawatt assets over the next year  I would expect the stock itself to move a bit more sideways for about a year until it starts bringing all those new assets on line  Once it does  you can start thinking about a dividend increase for 2014  but not for 2013  Innergex Renewable Energy Inc    TSX  is another solid company with a good track record of growth and executing on its development projects  Algonquin and Brookfield would be my short term favorites here  and then late in 2013  I d be looking at Northland and Primary Energy After that  we get to companies that are a little smaller but still decent investments  Capstone Turbine Corp    NYSE   Primary Energy Recycling Corp     and Sprott Power Corp     all have lower yields as well  given that they have a good payout ratio  So they re 75  or lower in terms of dividend to free cash flow TER  Given what you currently see on the horizon  how should investors interested in alternative energy stocks play this market in the coming year JM  I m still emphasizing safety for the majority of your holdings in this space  You might also want to pick up a few of the juniors that you think could become takeover targets or already are  such as Western Wind  We ll have to see what happens after the fiscal cliff is hopefully avoided and whether the federal government turns some attention back to renewables TER  We ll know much more about that relatively quickly  Meanwhile  we appreciate your input JM  My pleasure Jacob Securities Senior Vice President for Research John

fair representation of ETFs available  We believe investors may choose from this list an appropriate ETF to satisfy the best index based offerings available The Conservative EndUtility investments are at the conservative end of investing  Most investors buy them for the steady dividends and lower market volatility  This feature hasn t changed much Currently  utilities are under significant regulatory and macro economic pressure  From a regulatory point of view  most utilities need a more contemporary grid  but the climate is uncertain given a wide variety of local issues Power issuesAtop this are fuel issues including whether to upgrade older plants with cheap and readily available coal  natural gas  oil or nuclear  Hydro electric systems seem completely stopped from an environmental view and most available sources have been tapped  Nuclear power seems safe enough for new plants but with an old Fukushima plant and disaster in the publics  mind  these unfortunately seem an unlikely source  Oil powered utilities are more acceptable but fuel costs are high  Alternative  green  energy is still unavailable in the amount necessary and are more costly  The best bet is natural gas  which utilities are moving toward and away from coal where possible Another drag on public utilities is the economic climate  When the economy slows  power use drops as too  Perhaps the best example is the high number of vacant homes in the U S  currently with unused meters ETFs are based on indexes tied to well known index providers including Russell  S P  Barclays  MSCI  Dow Jones

288219,AAPL,Here s Why People Already Hate The IPhone 7,opinion,"Shares of Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   fell nearly 2 25  in morning trading Thursday following the relatively poor public reaction to its latest keynote event on Wednesday  Although the tech giant s latest mobile phone has yet to even begin shipping  consumers everywhere are furious over the company s decision to remove one key feature from the device 
In front of a packed crowd at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco  Apple unveiled a variety of new products and services  including the iPhone 7  While the new iPhone boasts new colors  water and dust resistance  and improved camera capabilities  people are upset about the company s decision to remove the industry standard 3 5mm headphone jack

Instead of the familiar headphone plug  iPhone 7 and 7 Plus users will connect to the phone s Lightning port  which is also used for charging the device  Apple will include a pair of EarPods with a Lightning connector and an adapter for analog headphones with every purchase of its latest generation of phones

This is clearly a big change in the industry  and as big changes oftentimes go  people aren t immediately excited about it  People also seem frustrated with Apple s new wireless headphone option  the  AirPods   which will retail for around  160

It s probably fair to say that Apple s decision was at least partially motivated by the desire to move users away from third party accessories  and while I doubt that Apple designed any product specifically to be lost or broken  it can t be denied that the company will benefit from repeat sales

394866,AIG,Insurance gaps leave shipping exposed to growing cyber threats,news,"By Jonathan Saul and Carolyn Cohn LONDON  Reuters    Shipping companies grappling with the threat of cyber attacks on vessels are finding insurance policies often fall short  officials involved in both industries say  a risk that could feed through into global prices  Digitalization means electricity networks  emergency services  industry and agriculture are all vulnerable to hacking by criminal gangs for extortion or  for political reasons  by militant groups or foreign states  But ships are also exposed to interference through electronic navigation devices such as the Global Positioning System  GPS  and lack the backup systems airliners have to prevent crashes  With 90 percent of world trade transported by vessels  the stakes are high  Gaps in insurance for ship owners and the disruptions that could cause have the potential to drive up both industrial and consumer prices   In a particularly secretive industry  information about the nature of attacks is scarce  which insurance and shipping officials say is an obstacle to mitigating the risk  There is also a gap in provision  because most existing cyber or hull insurance policies will not cover the risk of a navigation system being jammed or physical damage to the ship caused by a hacking attack   Shipping is very vulnerable not just to jamming of their systems but now to spoofing as well   said professor David Last  strategic advisor to the government affiliated General Lighthouse Authorities of the UK and Ireland  referring to devices that can transmit false GPS signals  The most high profile reported cyber attacks involving shipping so far had wider targets  Last year  South Korea said hundreds of fishing vessels had returned early to port after its GPS signals were jammed by North Korea  which denied responsibility  and an earlier hack by drug traffickers diverted containers in Belgium s Antwerp port  Other cases have had a lower profile  U S  Coast Guard officials have said GPS interference disrupted operations at an undisclosed U S  port for several hours in 2014 and reported a similar attack at a non U S  port  also unnamed  in 2015  In the latter attack  the Coast Guard said affected ships were able to navigate using radar  compasses and landmarks and urged operators to make sure such skills were not lost  It also called for more information sharing on cyber threats  RANSOMWARE North  a British based international marine mutual liability insurer  said last month there were likely to be gaps in cover as there was little data and risks were not well understood  Jamie Monck Mason  executive director for cyber and TMT at insurance broker Willis Towers Watson  said attacks on ships were not covered by the insurance shipowners have traditionally held   Marine hull and cargo policies typically contain a cyber attack exclusion   he said  while adding that large policyholders could negotiate to have the exclusion removed  However  an earlier report by North said attempts to cause shipping accidents were rare at the moment   The risks of this are currently thought to be low for most companies   it said  A veil was lifted on the scale of the wider problem when CSO Alliance  a trade association for maritime security professionals  said a quarter of the ship owners represented at a confidential workshop it had run admitted cyber incidents in the past year  Ship operator Consolidated Marine Management said in a presentation last month that  ransomware  attacks  where hackers scramble a ship s computer system and seek a ransom to unscramble it  were one of the main challenges   SILENT  POLICY Regulators are also concerned that a  silent  property policy   which neither mentions nor excludes cyber attacks   is not adequate  a problem too for other industries that face cyber attacks on their property such as power plants  Britain s insurance regulator said in November such policies could leave insurers open to large losses from cyber breaches and that policy holders  may find it challenging to understand whether they are covered   The world s number one container shipping line Maersk acknowledged the cyber risk to its fleet and said it was working to mitigate it   We currently see a trend towards the gap in insurance cover being closed   it said  Products are emerging from specialist insurer Sciemus Cyber Ltd as well as large insurers such as American International Group Inc NYSE AIG   while reinsurer Munich Re is also developing cover   It s about figuring out how to connect the gap between a property loss and a cyber loss   said Dieter Berg  head of business development  marine at Munich Re and president of the International Union of Marine Insurers   This is the process of discussion with the client   where is your exposure   AIG launched a standalone cyber policy last year  CyberEdge Plus  which protects the policyholder from property damage among other issues  It did not immediately respond to a request for pricing comment and has previously declined to discuss pricing  Sciemus was not immediately available to comment on the cost of its policies  It has said it charges energy utilities about  100 000 for  10 million in data breach insurance and as much as seven times that to cover attacks causing physical damage  Following an attack on a Ukrainian power plant in 2015  large utility companies have warned of their exposure to cyber risks in annual reports to regulators and that their insurance coverage might not cover all expenses related to an attack  
Those kind of warnings are largely absent from company reports in the shipping world  which is just waking up to the risks and has tight margins to take into account due to a near decade long industry slump  Graeme Charnock  chief financial officer with Peel Ports  which operates Liverpool port among other terminals in the UK and Ireland  said it was going through a risk assessment and would share it with its insurers in due course   To the extent cover is available  it will ultimately come down to how much it costs as measured against the perceived threats  ",2017-01-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/insurance-gaps-leave-shipping-exposed-to-growing-cyber-threats-452731,452731

355135,GOOGL,U S  Republicans press for F 35 fighter jet sales to Taiwan amid China threat,news,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Two senior U S  Republican senators asked the Trump administration on Monday to allow the sale of  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT   F 35 fighter jets to Taiwan  saying it would help it  remain a democracy  in the face of threats from China 
China s hostility towards self ruled Taiwan has grown since Tsai Ing wen from the pro independence Democratic Progressive Party won presidential elections on the island in 2016  China claims Taiwan as its own and is one of its most sensitive issues 
 These fighters will have a positive impact on Taiwan s self defense and would act as a necessary deterrent to China s aggressive military posture across the Asia Pacific region   Senators John Cornyn  the assistant majority leader  and James Inhofe  a senior member of the Armed Services Committee  said in a letter to President Donald Trump 
 After years of military modernization  China shows the ability to wage war against Taiwan for the first time since the 1950s   they wrote   However  with your leadership  it is possible to help Taiwan remain a democracy  free to establish a relationship with China that is not driven by military coercion  
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
China has been increasing its military exercises around Taiwan and making markedly stronger public comments about the need to prevent Taiwan independence On Tuesday  retired Chinese general Wang Hongguang explained how easy it would be for China to attack Taiwan in an opinion piece in widely read state run newspaper the Global Times  including a mass bombardment which would render Taiwan s military inoperable within 48 hours 
Taiwan s main command center outside Taipei is also clearly marked out on Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  maps  Wang  a former deputy commander of the Nanjing military region  wrote 
 It would be like picking off lice on the head of bald man   Wang added 
TAIWAN PRESIDENT PRAISES U S  TIES
The sale of the jets could increase tensions with Beijing  where officials were infuriated when Trump signed legislation this month that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts and vice versa 
On Tuesday  the office of Taiwan s president reiterated its support for the legislation and awarded U S  Representative Ed Royce  who is currently visiting the island  a medal of honor for his contributions toward Taiwan U S  relations 
 President Tsai believes that stable relations between Taiwan and the U S  serve as an important foundation for peace  stability and prosperity in the Indo Pacific region  Taiwan has the ability and is willing to work with the United States in the Indo Pacific region to make more contributions   the presidential office said 
Separately  Liu Jieyi  head of China s Taiwan Affairs Office  told state television late on Monday that  certain Americans  were trying to play the Taiwan card  which harmed the interest of people both in China and Taiwan 
 This is duping Taiwan compatriots   Liu said  without naming any U S  officials   It is futile for any outside forces to try to play the Taiwan card and do anything to harm the interest of the Chinese people  
The U S  military has put countering China and Russia at the center of a new national defense strategy unveiled by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in January 
Other U S  allies in the Asia Pacific region  such as Singapore  also are exploring the purchase of the stealthy F 35

Marc Ostwald  a strategist with ADM ISI in London  said that the volume of goods set to be hit with tariffs  at  11 billion  is  relatively modest  but said  it still sends the wrong signal in terms of  direction of travel  on bilateral U S  EU trade relations  
Boeing  NYSE BA   which would be the notional beneficiary of trade measures taken in its defense by the U S   is indicated down another 0 1  in premarket trading  after falling over 4  on Monday in response to its announcement that it would cut production of the 737 Max model by up to a fifth

420657,MO,SABMiller to scrutinize AB InBev mega deal after regulator approval  chairman,news,By Freya Berry LONDON  Reuters    The chairman of SABMiller  L SAB  said the brewer would consider the attractiveness of a  107 billion offer by Anheuser Busch InBev  BR ABI  after the merger had undergone the regulatory process  The takeover of the London listed brewer has come under scrutiny in recent weeks as a drop in the British currency has reduced the relative attractiveness of the all cash offer aimed at most SAB shareholders  A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that the company s board was weighing the terms of AB InBev s offer  amid rising shareholder disquiet  At the company s annual general meeting on Thursday  Chairman Jan du Plessis said the board would consider the offer after receiving preconditions from Chinese regulators  and also take into account the drop in sterling since the UK s vote in June to leave the European Union  The firm would then write to shareholders  he said  The maker of beers such as Castle Lager  Peroni and Grolsch earlier reported group net revenue fell 4 percent in its first quarter  ended June 30  with volume flat  Du Plessis described the pending takeover by AB InBev as a  significant distraction   but said the deal was right for the company and its shareholders   It received approval on Wednesday from U S  antitrust regulators  after the two companies agreed to sell assets and preserve competition from independent craft brewers  Australia  Europe and South Africa have also cleared the deal  The companies are waiting for China to approve it although a proposed sale of SABMiller s stake in CR Snow was expected to lead to clearance  The deal is expected to close by the end of the year  Some shareholders expressed concern on Thursday about the impact of Brexit and the fall in sterling   Concerns were also voiced about a stock and cash alternative structure  created as part of the takeover and designed for SAB s biggest investors  cigarette maker Altria  N MO  and Colombia s Santo Domingo family  Du Plessis defended the partial share alternative  PSA  structure  saying it had been vital for securing approval of the takeover from the two major shareholders   He said he would  make a point  of asking AB InBev to issue shares as part of a share swap  in order for SABMiller shareholders to have a holding in the newly merged company  When the original deal was announced in November  the PSA    which avoids triggering large tax bills    was worth about 39 pounds   51 45   The cash offer was 44 pounds per share   But the recent fall in the pound and rise in ABI s shares have increased its value to about 51 pounds  representing a premium of around 15 percent to the cash offer   That disparity has apparently tempted activists into SABMiller s shareholdings  Both The Children s Investment Fund  TCI  and hedge fund Elliott Advisors have taken small stakes  prompting talk that the two could lead a push for AB InBev to bump up its cash offer ,2016-07-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sabmiller-to-scrutinize-ab-inbev-mega-deal-after-regulator-approval:-chairman-415742,415742

264084,BAC,Buy 5 Mutual Funds With Dividend Yields Over 5 ,opinion,"June s stellar jobs report eased worries about the U S  economy  helping stocks move north  But  demand for bonds continues to increase pushing their price higher and dragging yields to record lows  Traditionally  stocks and bonds move in opposite direction as stocks are considered risky assets  while bonds are safe haven bets 

	So  why are investors latching on to bonds despite the encouraging jobs report  That s simply because investors are still concerned about the impact Brexit will have on Britain s economy  Global growth is also expected to slow down  creating fresh bouts of volatility in the financial markets  As bond yields decline  income seeking investors look for funds that are exposed to stocks providing juicy dividends  A low interest rate environment is also a boon for dividend paying companies 

U S  Bond Yields Closed at Fresh Lows

	It seems long term bonds are out of sync with the economy  Despite the strongest employment report in eight years  which confirmed that economic expansion is still intact  safe havens such as bonds were still bought  Payrolls in the U S  grew by 287 000 last month  way above analysts  expectations  dispelling fears that the U S  economy was headed for a recession 

	Bond prices increased due to higher demand  but their yields plunged  According to Tradeweb  the 10 year Treasury note settled at 1 366  on Friday  slightly below its previous record close of 1 367  set on Tuesday  The 30 year Treasury yield closed at its lowest ever level of 2 110  on Friday  read    

	Like the Treasury yields  term premiums too have fallen considerably in recent times  The term premium is down to a record low of 0 71 percentage points  Term premiums are the excess yield that investors demand for holding a long term bond instead of a series of shorter term bonds  read    

Free Fall in Yields Across the Globe

	Investors in Europe and Japan continue to pile into government debt  dragging down yields  According to Bank of America Corporation  NYSE BAC    about  276 billion of euro denominated corporate bonds are trading at a negative yield  Italy has around  1 6 trillion worth of negative yielding sovereign debt  The yield on Germany s 10 year bund slipped less than 1 basis point to a negative 0 17  on Friday  while U K  s 10 year gilt yield was also down less than 1 basis point to 0 77   according to Tradeweb  read    

	Citigroup Inc   added that almost 80  of Japanese government bonds have negative yields  Elsewhere  in other developed nations like New Zealand  10 year bond yields decreased to about 2 3  from 3 6   Overall  global negative yielding debt is around  13 trillion  while it was almost none in mid 2014  according to Bank of America 

Brexit Woes

	So  why are investors pouring into U S  debt  driving yields lower  This is because they harbor serious concerns about the strength of the global economy particularly after the late June British referendum to leave the EU  British voters ignored common wisdom and the advice of notable economists to vote in favor of an exit  Market pundits had warned that a Brexit will negatively affect financial conditions and the global economy 

	Fed Chair Janet Yellen had said that such a move would  usher in a period of uncertainty  and fuel volatility in world markets  A Brexit will lead to lower business investment in Britain and muted consumer confidence  This in turn will have an unfavorable spillover effect worldwide and the U S  won t be spared either  read    

5 Best Dividend Mutual Funds to Buy Now

	Companies that have comparatively higher and stable dividend yields are more attractive now  thanks to the decline in Treasury yields  Income focused investors will now turn toward mutual funds exposed to such dividend paying stocks that provide the regular cash they are seeking  Additionally  interest rates around the world are falling even lower after U K  s Brexit vote  which makes dividend payers more alluring  read    

	By the way  a dividend yield of more than 5  is the sweet spot  This is because investors can expect some growth  which is important in any investment as higher growth leads to higher returns  Moreover  such a yield will add to cash inflows and with more money in the pocket investors can buy more shares especially in a falling market 

	Hence  we have selected five dividend paying mutual funds that offer a dividend yield of over 5   Such funds boast a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy  and their percentage of net assets invested in common stocks is greater than 70  

	Funds have been selected over stocks  since funds reduce transaction costs for investors  Funds also diversify their portfolio without the numerous commission charges that stocks need to bear  read

324941,TGT,Psychology weds finance in Ponzi scheme frauds,news,"  Ponzi schemes feed on human weakness
   Frauds target  affinity groups   cultivate trust
   Unnaturally high returns among the biggest  red flags 
 By Pascal Fletcher
 MIAMI  April 28  Reuters    Take the malleable clay of
human nature  add greed  deceit and manipulation  and you have
the basic ingredients for a Ponzi scheme financial fraud 
 Throw in  bird dogs    boiler room boys   socialite
philanthropists   front  companies  slick sales talk and glossy
promotion  These are some of the accessories that can turn a
simple scam into a persuasive fictional investment vehicle 
 As victims and regulators still digest the shock of the
recent scandals involving disgraced financier Bernard Madoff or
Texas billionaire Allen Stanford  experts are probing the
psychological and financial components of Ponzi schemes 
 The Ponzi scheme is named after Italian immigrant Charles
Ponzi whose 1919 1920 fraud was a cause celebre in Boston 
 It works on the simple principle of luring investors by
promising attractively high returns  while in fact paying its
early clients with the money provided by later investors 
 While basically insolvent from the start  it feeds 
fraudulently  on the natural desire to obtain financial gain 
  It s human nature and psychology  it s preying on
individuals that are vulnerable   Maria Yip  a forensic
accounting expert at Yip Associates  told Reuters 
 She and other fraud experts explained to an offshore
finance conference in Miami on Tuesday some of the common
attributes of Ponzi schemes  which have bilked investors in the
United States and elsewhere out of billions of dollars 
 Successful Ponzi schemes prey on close knit communities of
victims  so called  affinity groups   which the perpetrators of
the frauds are either already linked to or can tap into 
 For example  Madoff  who has pleaded guilty to Wall
Street s biggest ever investment swindle involving  65 billion
in client funds  found many of his customers among the wealthy
Jewish communities of Florida and New York 
  They are going for groups of people where they can build
the trust quickly  it could be synagogues or churches or
retirement communities   Yip said 
 Stanford  who is accused by U S  regulators of an  8
billion fraud  but who denies running a Ponzi scheme  was a   
 red blooded American marketing to Americans   said D C  Page 
a managing partner of Verasys  who sat on the experts  panel 
 While some smaller Ponzi frauds may operate only by word of
mouth  larger  more sophisticated schemes often cloak
themselves in a facade of respectability  with plush offices 
investment advisers  nominal auditors and glossy literature 
 Some also involve  bird dog  promoters  who work on
recruiting investors  and  boiler room staff   who work the
telephones using lists of potential victims  These lists are
sometimes sold on the black market among swindlers 
  RED FLAGS  AND  DRIPPING ROAST 
 At the center of the Ponzi scheme is the mastermind  who
experts say often poses as a gifted investment strategist 
cultivating an air of mystery or cloaking his activities with
donations to charity and acts of social philanthropy 
  It s the guru behind the curtain   said Michael A 
Tessitore  a lawyer who has acted on behalf of victims of Ponzi
schemes and frauds in the United States and Latin America 
 Investors are often told they are being made part of a
privileged group  which maintains an air of cloistered secrecy
around the frauds and discourages asking questions 
 But the experts say  often one blunt simple common sense
question   Is this too good to be true    would have been
enough to puncture the deceit surrounding the promises of
dazzling financial rewards 
 Promises of above average returns defying market trends are
among the biggest  Red Flags  signaling a potential fraud 
  The market place is pretty efficient  If they re telling
you you ll be getting oddly high returns and that it s
guaranteed  there s something wrong   said Mitchell Herr  an
attorney and partner at Holland and Knight 
 Other tell tale signs are grandiose  but incomprehensible
investment strategies and  unbusinesslike  use of money  Page
said one scheme listed investment in  sunken pirate treasure  
 Lack of clear and demonstrable financial oversight should
also ring alarm bells  the experts said 
 For example  Herr said Madoff s vast investment empire was
served by a  three person audit shop   while Stanford s bank
offering high yield certificates of deposit was nominally
audited by a  72 year old gentleman from Antigua   who in fact
died at the beginning of this year 
 Discovery is only the first part of the dismantling of a
Ponzi scheme 
 The second is the fight between receivers  liquidators and
lawyers for what Martin Kenney  an attorney and economic crime
expert based in the British Virgin Islands  calls  the dripping
roast  of the scheme s assets and those of its organizers 
  The investigation  the recovery becomes a feeding frenzy
of professionals  It is not uncommon for there to be nothing at
the end  but the fees to pay the professionals     that adds
insult to injury   said attorney Tessitore

422411,COG,Here s Why W T Offshore  WTI  Stock Is A Must Buy Right Now,opinion,"W T Offshore  Inc    NYSE WTI   holds tremendous upside potential due to its growing presence in the deep water and shelf of Gulf of Mexico  GoM   wherein production grew more than 500  and proved reserves surged nearly 900  over the past eight years  The company s increasing reserve base in the GoM  the second largest basin in the United States in terms of production  will boost output in the coming quarters 
Let s delve deeper to analyse the factors that make W T Offshore an attractive investment option at the moment 
Offshore Resurgence  We would like to remind investors that the steadiness in oil prices at the current levels of above  60 per barrel is driving operators to make longer term plans  as deepwater projects become cost effective  Producers like Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc   which holds huge potential in the U S  GoM  recently put up an interesting picture for investors at the Scotia Howard Weil Energy Conference in New Orleans  These companies expect offshore production to come out of the shadows of shale drilling  reflecting a resurgence 
GoM Strength  The company s extensive presence in the GoM is commendable  Its operations are spread across roughly 48 oil and gas offshore fields  covering around 650 000 gross acres  It covers roughly 440 000 gross acres in the GoM shelf  while the company operates across 210 000 gross acres in the deepwater  Notably  W T Offshore created a joint venture with a group of investors to drill 14 pre defined projects in the GoM over more than three years 
The GoM provides unique advantages  including low decline rates  world class permeability and significant potential reserves that are untapped  The company recorded 60 4 million barrels of oil equivalent  MMBoe  of proven or 1P reserves in the GoM shelf  In the deepwater GoM  it has 21 7 MMBoe of 1P reserves  Significant proved reserve bases in both the shelf and deepwater resources will contribute to the upstream energy player s cash flows 
Surging Cashflow  Through 2018  the company generated  321 8 million of operating cash flows  which more than doubled from the 2017 level of  159 4 million  We expect this momentum to continue in the coming quarters as well  backed by higher realized crude and natural gas liquids prices  and lower expenditure on plugging and abandonment activities 
Liquidity  By the end of 2018  W T Offshore reduced its long term debt by 34 6  from the year ago level to  634 million  This visible downward trend can be noticed in the company s balance sheet for the last few years  as shown in the figure below  Moreover  total liquidity of  252 7 million  as of Dec 31  2018  for this small cap company is remarkable  Overall  the financial flexibility enables the company to support its growth projects 

 
Upbeat Production Guidance  For full year 2019  W T Offshore expects production in the band of 12 9 14 3 MMBoe  The upper limit of the band is much higher than the 2018 level of 13 3 MMBoe 
As you can see  the company s strong fundamentals and strategic positioning makes it well poised to outperform the market in the coming days  The analysts also believe so and consequently hiked its guidance in the last few weeks  Over the past month  earnings estimates for the current year have risen from 43 cents per share to 73 cents 
Price Movement  The Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company s upside potential has also been reflected in the stock movement  Its shares significantly outperformed the in the past year  During the said period  the upstream company gained 58 7  against the 18 9  decline of its industry 

 
Moreover  on the basis of the trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  the industry is currently trading at 5 3X  significantly lower than one year high mark of 7 2X  This also confirms the stock s strong upside potential  Since oil and gas companies are debt laden  it makes sense to value them based on the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio  This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt

282655,AAPL,Bargain Hunting  Week s Price Action Indicates Cautious Yes ,opinion,"The Standard and Poors 500 Index  SPX  closed Friday at 2732  I was glad to see the 50 day moving average  dma  broken  but it was just barely broken  SPX ran up to 2754  but then declined to close just seven points above the 50 dma  Tomorrow s open will confirm whether resistance at the 50 dma has really been broken  SPX s closing low on 2 8 at 2581 represents a 10 2  correction from the high of 2873 on 1 26  Technical analysts normally categorize corrections as declines around 10   so this is in the expected ballpark  Friday s close has recovered about half of the decline 
Is the correction complete  Is it safe to seek bargains in the market  The price action this week would certainly suggest that conclusion  But don t jump too fast  The opening tomorrow morning will be critical  This week will be the opportunity for a possible retest of the lows  Pull up the price chart for SPX during the last severe correction in December 2015  That correction was initially 10 5   but the retest about three weeks later took the correction to 12   It required nearly four months to fully recover  By contrast  the strength of the recovery last week was significant at 50  or more on all major market indices  That initial bounce back in February 2016 was weak  about 81 points or a 37  recovery 
Market analysts agree that the economic fundamentals are strong  The earnings announcements for the fourth quarter have been consistently strong  If anything  some analysts are starting to fret that earnings are growing too fast 
The Russell 2000 Index  RUT  closed Friday at 1544  recovering over half of its 9 1  loss since RUT s high on 1 23  The 200 dma served as the solid support level for the Russell index  It was touched on 2 6  and the close two days later was just above the 200 dma  Although the 200 dma was broken intraday on 2 9  the close was well above the 200 dma and RUT s recovery was underway 
The NASDAQ Composite traded similarly to RUT but remained 75 points above the 200 dma at its lowest point intraday on 2 9  NASDAQ s trading volume fell off this week  trading at or below the 50 dma all week  As of Friday  NASDAQ had recovered 76  of its losses 
The volatility index of the S P 500  VIX  opened the week at 27 3  and closed yesterday at 19 5   The closing high for VIX during this correction was 37 3  on Monday of the previous week  although VIX hit 50  intraday on Tuesday  2 6  Friday s close just under 20  brought VIX back to the 20 dma in the middle of the Bollinger  bands  That level of the volatility index certainly isn t low  We aren t out of the woods yet  If the market turns to test those lows  we could see VIX spike again before things calm down 
The U S  exchanges are closed today  Asian markets rallied overnight  but Europe is flat to slightly down today  The U S  markets have established six positive market days since the low on February 8th  so I am inclined to think we have seen the worst of this correction  SPX and RUT have recovered about half of those losses at this point  and NASDAQ has recovered about three quarters of the correction loss  Given the past six positive days  it wouldn t be surprising to see the markets trade sideways or even pull back modestly tomorrow  The positive to slightly negative price action on global markets overnight and today supports that conclusion  My opinion is that we have seen the worst of this correction  I am beginning to establish new positions  The Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  diagonal spread I entered for our trading group is just one example  But I remain cautious ",2018-02-19,Dr. Duke,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bargain-hunting-200291873,200291873

437411,VZ,FCC To Scrap Stringent Business Data Service Regulations,opinion,"Yesterday  the U S  telecom regulator   Federal Communications Commission  FCC    voted 2 1 to withdraw most of the stringent regulatory requirements to reform the business data service  BDS  market  The BDS reform report was introduced by the previous FCC body that was led by Tom Wheeler under the Democratic rule  However  the new FCC  reconstructed by President Trump and headed by Ajit Pai  has ushered a less restrictive regime 
The BDS market  where telecom operators and cable MSOs  multi service operators  provide a host of network related services to business entities of various sizes  has been a lucrative source of revenues in the recent years for service providers  Significantly  these service providers have been generating handsome revenues by frequently charging steep prices from small and medium businesses  At present  BDS is a  45 billion market opportunity per annum 
In 2016  the FCC proposed rules to regulate pricing in the market  citing low competition  The proposals include   1  removal of tariffs  2  not classifying telecom providers as either dominant or non dominant carriers  3  implementing a new Competitive Market Test to determine where competition exists  4  imposing technology neutral regulations  5  instituting price caps on access to legacy TDM networks in non competitive markets  6  setting wholesale prices in relation to retail prices for any given service in non competitive markets

413523,APA,Brexit  How Does It Affect Energy  Here Are A Few Answers ,opinion,"The Votes Are In    Great Britain Will Not Remain Part Of The European Union  EU 
By a margin of 51 9  to 48 1  on a 72 2  turnout  the U K  electorate voted to leave the EU in a historic referendum 
Why the  NO  Vote
Supporters of  Vote Leave  mainly point toward Europe s migration crisis and continued Eurozone travails  Their stance is based on the premise that the EU has out served its purpose and has held back Britain  Exit from the bloc can help Britain to have free trade deals with countries  take back full control of its borders and choose who comes to their country 
The skeptics were able to outnumber the  Remain  camp who believed that Britain gets a boost from EU membership  as it makes selling things to EU countries easier  Moreover  the flow of immigrants fuels economic growth 
Triggers Market Uncertainty
Following Brexit   the short way of saying Britain s exit from the EU   the FTSE 250 index plunged more than 10   The seismic shock from the  Leave  campaign victory has been so severe that Prime Minister David Cameron announced his decision to resign from his post by October 
However  the impact to secede from the EU is unlikely to remain insulated to Britain 
As expected  the undeniable and immediate fallout was the plunge in the value of the British pound  which crashed to 1985 lows  This would lead to a flight toward safe haven currencies like the dollar  A stronger dollar would create multiple challenges for a Federal Reserve which has just wound up a program of monetary easing and is looking for opportunities to raise rates 
In such a scenario  it is next to impossible that U S  markets would be spared  In fact  by the looks of the futures  the US markets are expected to experience a  Black Friday  and effects of the stunning development are likely to be felt not only throughout today s trading session but also in the days to come 
With Britain accounting for   a hammering for U S  stocks cannot be ruled out in the wake of Brexit turning into a reality  US firms  with exposure to Britain  are likely to hit badly with the tumbling pound reducing U S  earnings on repatriating the income 
And Oil Selloff
Adding to the general atmosphere of chaos in the markets  the British referendum to break with Europe also buckled oil prices  which retreated more than 6  to under  48 a barrel Oils Energy Sector Price Index
The biggest single day plunge in over 2 months could be traced to the following concerns 
The most pressing concern for the industry right now is the exacerbation of the already challenging environment created by the low oil prices  As it is  crude prices fell to a 12 year low in Feb  threatening the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and pummeling producer s profit margins 
However  indications that supply was easing helped oil prices rebound some 90  since then  At this juncture  Brexit will only add to the wave of uncertainties and increase the commodity s volatility 
The ensuing market turmoil   amid talks of a second Scottish Independence referendum   might impact investment plans for new project sanctions that is already at a historic low because of the oil price crash 
There is a belief among the U S  officials that exit of the world s fifth largest economy from the EU will hit U S   biggest trading partner s growth  which in turn will weaken the domestic economy and reduce oil demand 
European oil companies like TOTAL S A    TO TOT   and Statoil  OL STL  ASA   NYSE STO   employ a number of U K  workers in EU countries and vice versa  Following Brexit  these workers might have to be granted  non EU  citizen status that could escalate employer costs   something the industry would like to avoid in this low price environment 
The dollar s strengthening will likely make the greenback priced crude more expensive for investors holding foreign currency and suppress prices 
Energy Investors  Prepare for a Bumpy Ride  but Don t Panic
While Brexit will be a blow to U S  oil explorers and producers like Apache Corp    NYSE APA     that get around a fifth of their sales from the U K    such cases are few and far between  In any case  the U K  constitutes a miniscule 1 6  of global crude demand  so the commodity is unlikely to be too affected by a Brexit vote  Moreover  with core oil fundamentals still unchanged  the commodity is well set for a long term recovery though one might have to wait for the dust to settle 
In fact  once the hoopla over Brexit dies down  the two Britain based oil majors   Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and BP plc  LON BP    NYSE BP     could even become attractive investment options  With oil futures plunging  these quality names are likely to get sold off sharply amid the global financial panic  Considering that both Shell and BP are well positioned to leverage the world s growing energy need  one could buy them later in the summer at even lower prices when they move upward from their current Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The weak pound will make dollar based investing even more attractive ",2016-06-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/brexit:-how-does-it-affect-energy-here-are-a-few-answers-200138128,200138128
291978,BAC,FTSE rebound led by miners  Burberry up on update,news,"  FTSE rises 0 6 percent
   Miners up  Anglo American gains on DB note
   Luxury goods firms higher after Burberry  LVMH impress
 
 By David Brett
 LONDON  April 19  Reuters    Britain s top shares bounced
back from sharp falls in the previous session on Tuesday  led by
oversold commodity stocks and luxury goods firm Burberry after a
trading update 
 By 1053 GMT  the FTSE 100 was up 32 75 points  or 0 6
percent  at 5 902 83  having ended Monday down 2 1 percent at
5 870 08  its lowest close since March 23  after ratings agency
S P cut its U S  credit outlook to negative 
 Bill McNamara  a technical analyst at Charles Stanley  said
the short term uptrend had come to an end  and the index would
need to hold above 5 908    last week s first key support level
   to have any technical significance 
  At the very least this signals that the FTSE has entered a
phase where choppy trade is likely to become the norm  and
that s not so surprising  given the many external factors that
investors are now obliged to take account of  
 London s blue chips rallied as investors bought back in on
the dips after a flight from risk on Monday  with miners and
integrated oils the top performing sectors 
 Paul Mumford  who manages a 25 million pound   40 6 million 
fund at Cavendish Asset Management  said the market fall was a
 knee jerk  reaction thar presented fresh buying opportunities 
 Precious metals miner Fresnillo gained 2 4 percent as gold
 hovered near all time highs 
 India focused miner Vedanta rose 1 6 percent  and Cairn
Energy climbed 1 percent as Vedanta snapped up an 11 percent
stake in Cairn India  a move that guarantees the miner a
majority stake in the Indian unit despite an expected tepid
response to its open offer 
 Anglo American was up 2 2 percent on a bullish note from
Deutsche Bank in which the broker noted the miner s exposure to
diamonds   the most defensive mining commodity  
 
 BURBERRY BEAT
 Burberry rose 5 9 percent after the luxury group said
fourth quarter sales beat forecasts and would push full year
profit to the top end of expectations 
 French peer LVMH also boosted investor sentiment when it
beat first quarter sales expectations 
 Marks   Spencer added 1 5 percent as Citigroup raised its
recommendation on the retailer to  buy  from  hold  
 Tesco fell 1 2 percent after the world s third largest
retailer fell short of its expectations in a tough home market 

 Engineers IMI and Weir put on 2 3 and 1 8 percent 
benefiting from an upbeat buzz on the sector from brokers such
as Bank of America Merrill Lynch and RBC Capital Markets 
 Banks were mixed as they remained hamstrung by global
sovereign debt concerns and ahead of U S  peer Goldman Sachs s
results at around 1200 GMT 
 U S  stock index futures pointed to a slightly lower open on
Wall Street on Tuesday  with U S  March housing starts numbers
due at 1230 GMT

391205,MUR,Murphy Oil  MUR  Tops Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Murphy Oil  MUR  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 21 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 18 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 36 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 16 67   A quarter ago  it was expected that this oil and gas producer would post earnings of  0 10 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 15  delivering a surprise of 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Murphy Oil  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry  posted revenues of  709 05 million for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17 09   This compares to year ago revenues of  618 19 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Murphy Oil shares have lost about 7 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15  
What s Next for Murphy Oil 
While Murphy Oil has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Murphy Oil was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 26 on  762 77 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  0 90 on  2 69 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States is currently in the bottom 27  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-08-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/murphy-oil-mur-tops-q2-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200452831,200452831
416387,UAL,Is United Continental  UAL  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  United Continental has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  the current level stands way below the highs for the stock  indicating that it could be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that United Continental has forward PE of 11 5x  so it is fair to expect a slight increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  United Continental has a P S ratio of about 0 6  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  United Continental currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes United Continental a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 2  which is far better than the industry average of 6 2  Clearly  UAL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall While United Continental might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of C  This gives UAL a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen NINE estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to none lower  while the next year estimate has also seen nine up and none down in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate has increased nearly 4 9  in the past one month  while the next year estimate has moved up by 8 2   You can see

Uber s Travis Kalanick is leaving the board  and that s a good thing  analyst says

The news that Uber Inc  co Founder and former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick is leaving the company s board effective Dec  31 is a positive for the company  freeing its current management up to strike their own path forward  Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Tuesday ",2019-12-24,MarketWatch,https://invst.ly/p7zfp,2047885
228457,BBSI,Trade War Heats Up  Here Are The Winners   Losers ,opinion,"Wall Street now braces for a full fledged trade war between two of the world s largest economies as the United States bumped up tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese products  Unfortunately  last minute talks between U S  trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese vice premier Liu He failed to salvage months of encouraging reports hinting at substantial progress in trade talks   Tariffs on Chinese goods have risen to 25  from 10   and Beijing has pledged to retaliate  China s Commerce Ministry said that  the Chinese side deeply regrets that it will have to take necessary countermeasures   The Ministry added that  it hoped that the U S  and the Chinese side will work together to resolve existing problems through cooperation and consultation  The situation might worses as President Trump threatened to levy tariffs on all Chinese goods with America  And this means imposing tariffs on the remaining  325 billion worth of Chinese products  His moves will invariably affect more than 5 000 China made products  including fresh and frozen foods  chemicals  textiles  metalwork  building materials  electronics and consumer goods But  why are the United States and China at odds  China has always faced Trump s wrath  Trump criticized trade imbalances between the countries  Protection of intellectual property rights by the way continues to be a bone of contention for the economies  Chinese delegates said that they will deal with such issues but Trump wants  strong enforcement language   to police any deal  China views the trade war as U S   attempt to curb its growing influence across the globe Nonetheless  investors are worried that the trade war might easily destabilize an already slowing global economy and raise tensions between the superpowers regarding South China Sea and industrial espionage  The International Monetary Fund  in the meantime  warned a tariff war would pose a  threat to the global economy   The body  which aims to ensure global financial stability  asked for a speedy resolution With possibilities of a heightened U S  China trade war looming  the stock market is bleeding  But not all stocks are facing the brunt  Let us  thus  look at the potential winners and losers from the trade war  Two Tech Stocks That Avoid U S  China Trade ExposureTechnology stocks aren t in great shape  especially  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Thanks to trade related issues  Apple has trimmed its fiscal first quarter sales forecast  citing slowdown in iPhone sales in China  Chipmakers  revenues are also expected to be impacted if China retaliates  Intel Corporation  NASDAQ INTC  has cut its revenue forecast for 2019  citing lower demand from China But  two tech behemoths are less vulnerable to trade related concerns   Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB   and Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Mark Mahaney  lead technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets  said that these companies have a low exposure to China at roughly 1  to 2  Additionally  Facebook is less pricey when its price earnings ratio is considered  Netflix  incidentally  keeps producing top notch original content which should consistently drive revenues  Shares of Facebook and Netflix have advanced at a solid pace so far this year  While Facebook jumped 43 9   Netflix soared 35 5   Facebook currently flaunts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  while Netflix has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Why Thinking Small is Not the Only OptionIn the wake of the present trade scenario  investors seem to be shifting to small cap stocks  This is because such stocks tend to have higher proportion of domestic sales compared to large caps  But  in reality  the difference isn t much  Per data from FactSet Research  small cap stocks in the Russell 2000 index derive nearly 20 6  of their revenues from outside the United States  while stocks from the broader S P 500 obtain about 30 3  In this context  companies that derive most of their revenues from the United States should remain unaffected  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  chipped in that CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX   rakes in 100  of its sales from the United States  Intuit Inc    NASDAQ INTU   is another company that draws 95  of sales from the country  Goldman added  Hence  it s natural that these companies stand to gain the most from the trade war escalation  After all  their profits aren t getting eroded due to the limited exposure to foreign markets While shares of CSX Corporation have risen 25 8  on a year to date basis  Intuit gained 22 6   Both the companies boast a Zacks Rank  2 Service Firms Are Big GainersService firms are safe bets for now  Such firms are unperturbed by trade retaliations as they have less foreign sales exposure compared to goods companies  Service stocks also incur lower foreign input costs that might be subject to tariffs  Such input costs mostly related to direct materials  labor and factory overheads Some may argue that growth in the service sector  the main component of the U S  economy  has slowed for the second straight month in April  This is because the ISM nonmanufacturing index was 55 5 in April  compared with 56 1 in March  Let s admit  the current level is still above 50  indicating expansion  At the same time  job gains in the service sector continued to rise in April  whereas job gains in the manufacturing sector dropped for the third straight month Some of the service stocks that should make meaningful additions to your portfolio are Barrett Business Services  Inc    NASDAQ BBSI    Insperity  Inc    NYSE NSP    G III Apparel Group  Ltd   NASDAQ GIII    Stifel Financial Corp    NYSE SF   and Discover Financial Services   NYSE DFS    All of them have gained more than 25  so far this year and possess a solid Zacks Rank  read more     
Not So Lucky Ones One of the biggest area affected by trade tensions is the U S  automotive industry  Last year  China had increased tariffs from 15  to 40  on any U S  manufactured automobile entering the country  And now  with China contemplating more tariffs  things are surely not looking up for U S  automakers  General Motors  NYSE GM   in particular  projected  1 billion extra costs this year owing to tariffs  Harley Davidson also cautioned that its tariff related costs are expected to increase from  23 7 million in 2018 to more than  100 million this year What about heavy equipment makers  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  has claimed that tariffs would cost the company  250 million to  350 million in 2019  while Deere   Co expects U S  tariffs on Chinese imports to cost around  100 million this year Last but not the least  Archer Daniels Midland  the processor and seller of agricultural commodities  products  and ingredients  said that trade tensions will disrupt its supply chain and eventually dent earnings Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices  In the process  it s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3 trillion in activity A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech  Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  in the 1990s  Zacks  just released special report reveals 7 stocks to watch  The report is only available for a limited time ",2019-05-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trade-war-heats-up-here-are-the-winners--losers-200420268,200420268

Francois Fillon loses steam in French presidential race
In France  Francois Fillon refuses to lower his arms in the presidential race  although he has lost support from his party  UMP  There are rising speculations that AlainJupp  would actually win the first round of the election if he replaced Mr  Fillon  who is now referred to as  a danger to France  
Looking back in the history  we clearly observe that pre election scandals had significant impact on the results  Given that the first round of French elections is due in April 23rd  Mr  Fillon will most probably lack time to gain back the credibility of his party and his voters 
According to the latest Bloomberg survey  the probability of Fillon victory fell to 19  
Odds for the independent candidate Emmanuel Macron s victory rose by 4 30  to 24   meanwhile Front National s Marine Le Pen is given 27  chances to win the election  On a side note  Le Pen s victory is still seen as unlikely at the second and final tour of the election 
The EUR USD extended gains above 1 0620  the 100 day moving average  Solid resistance is eyed pre 1 0706  major 38 2  retracement on post Trump rally   if broken  should signal a mid term bullish reversal  whereas the divergence between the Federal Reserve  Fed  and European Central Bank  ECB  policy outlooks is supportive of a weak euro against the greenback  Therefore  a potential rise toward the 1 07 level could bump into a solid resistance

China revised its 2017 growth target slightly lower to 6 5  and more if possible  from 6 5  7  a year earlier  The inflation target has been kept at 3  year on year  the retail sales growth target remained stable at 10   The People s Bank of China  PBoC  lowered the M2 money supply target down to 12  and is expected to further tighten the monetary policy in order to ease the recent rise in inflationary pressures due to the sharp US dollar appreciation and the recovery in global oil and commodity prices  Also  a tighter monetary policy would reduce the bad loans and speculative bubbles  Chinese Premier Li has also signaled further liberalization of the Yuan s exchange rate  News were encouraging for investors  as further financial and regulatory reforms are the major caveats for foreign investors  and it appears that China is decidedly taking measures to allow a good basis for new investments  As a result  China is seeking 6 5  stable and balanced growth

323464,STLD,Here s Why You Should Hold On To POSCO  PKX  ADR For Now,opinion,We issued an updated research report on POSCO   NYSE PKX   on Apr 5  2018  Healthy demand for steel in domestic and international arenas  a large customer base in various end markets and strategic initiatives will support this South Korean steel producer s growth trajectory  However  high debt levels and stiff competition are major concerning factors The company  with a market capitalization of approximately  24 1 billion  carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Below  we briefly discussed the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds  Factors Favoring POSCOShare Price Performance and Healthy 2018 Projections  Last year  POSCO s American Depository Receipts  ADR  yielded 27 6  return  outperforming 16 7  gain recorded by the  Its financial performance in 2017 was impressive  with net income surging 183 8  year over year on revenue growth of 14 3   For 2018  the company anticipates consolidated revenues to be approximately KRW 61 9 trillion  higher than KRW 60 7 trillion recorded in 2017  Also  it predicts crude steel production to be roughly 37 4 million tons  higher than 37 2 million tons produced in 2017  Growth Potential Solid  POSCO operates through four business segments   Steel  Trading  Engineering   Construction and Others   largely minimizing its risks of loss from the poor performance of any group  Also  a vast customer base in various end markets  including economic research and consulting  architecture  electronic commerce  forest resources development  computer hardware and software distribution  crude oil   natural gas mining plus real estate development  is a boon We believe that any rise in investment for infrastructural development by the government  as well as anticipated growth in the automobile and shipbuilding industry of its home country  will work in its favor  Moreover  the World Steel Association predicts global steel consumption to grow 1 6  year over year in 2018  This forecast includes 1 1  growth in the United States  5 7  in India  1 4  in European Union  4 5  in the MENA region  6 8  in ASEAN countries and flat in China  Restructuring Initiatives  Measures undertaken to improve steel operations  as well as other prime businesses and overall profitability  will be advantageous  In this regard  completion of revamping work at Pohang Works  Blast Furnace  3  along with other maintenance projects in 2017  is worth mentioning  This move will assist in hassle free production in the future Also  the company believes in disposing of non core assets to strengthen the business portfolio  It worked on 150 restructuring cases  including 85 subsidiaries and 65 assets  during the 2014 2017 timeframe  Over time  these business restructuring activities resulted in the positive financial impact of KRW 7 trillion  including approximately KRW 5 7 trillion in proceeds and roughly KRW 1 3 trillion in debt reduction  Notably  the company worked on 26 restructuring cases in 2017  including 19 subsidiaries and seven assets  In the quarters ahead  the company intends to work on the business portfolio of its subsidiaries as well as initiate efforts to relocate growth businesses for enhancing its competitiveness  Factors Working Against POSCO Poor Valuation   Threats From International Expansion  On a P E  TTM  basis  POSCO s ADR looks overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 11 7x and 7 7x in the last year  This makes us cautious about the stock POSCO Price and Consensus    Also  global expansion has exposed the company to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies  Also  uncertainties in the economic growth of the countries served can severely impact its businesses  Internationally  its products are sold in China  Japan  Europe  the Middle East and North America  Huge Debts Raise Concerns  POSCO s non current liabilities was approximately KRW 12 6 trillion  exiting the fourth quarter of 2017  We believe  if unchecked  huge debt levels will increase its financial obligations and hence  prove detrimental to its profitability  Industry Competition  POSCO faces stiff competition from companies that have huge production capacity as well as from new players in the industry  primarily those originating from China and India Some key players in the steel industry are ArcelorMittal   NYSE MT    Schnitzer Steel Industries  Inc    NASDAQ SCHN   and Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD    All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  In the last 60 days  earnings estimates for both the stocks improved for the current year and the next year  Also  average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters was 39 43  for ArcelorMittal  0 81  for Schnitzer Steel Industries and 6 49  for Steel Dynamics  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been

413460,CVX,Chevron Boosts Venezuela Oil Output While U S  Is Eyeing New Sanctions,news," Bloomberg      Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  has ramped up output at a key Venezuela oil project to levels not seen in almost a year  offering a thorny reminder of how U S  sanctions are failing to deliver a knockout of Nicolas Maduro s regime 
The U S  is eyeing tougher sanctions that could target Russian producer Rosneft PJSC and potentially affect Chevron s waiver at a time when tensions between the two countries are escalating anew  Maduro  meanwhile  is considering giving foreign producers operational control at some fields to bring in added cash and  perhaps  to nudge other U S  oil companies to lobby for their own access to Venezuela s huge oil reserves 
 The likely goal is to make it so attractive  companies start to lobby harder in the U S    said Raul Gallegos  a Bogota  Colombia based director at Control Risks  an international consulting firm 
Chevron s waiver  which expires in April  has benefited both countries  mitigating the collapse in Venezuela s production and hindering further expansion by Russia and China  At the same time  it allows Chevron to remain the lone U S  player in a country with an estimated 302 8 billion barrels of oil reserves and a dysfunctional state oil company that s seen output fall by 74  since 2009 to about 792 000 barrels a day  according to the latest OPEC report 
Other U S  oil companies  meanwhile  say they re locked out   This is an America Last policy   said Ali Rahman  director of Delaware registered Erepla Services LLC  in an interview   The sanctions hurt American business interests    other than the select few granted licenses    more than anyone else  
In 2018  Erepla entered into a potentially lucrative contract with state controlled Petroleos de Venezuela SA to provide oilfield and marketing services to three fields  Soon after  the Trump administration tightened its sanctions  putting operations on hold  It sought a waiver similar to Chevron s  Rahman said  but never got a sign off 
The debate comes as Chevron has helped restore production at the Petropiar upgrader it runs as a joint project with PDVSA  according to people familiar with the operation  The upgrader turns the area s tar like oil into refinery ready Hamaca crude for export 
After being closed for parts of 2019  the site is now producing about 130 000 barrels a day of crude  the people said  asking not to be identified because the information is private  On paper  PDVSA controls Petropiar as majority owner  but Chevron has kept the oil flowing and helped repair the industrial facilities needed to refine the tar into marketable crude  the people said 
Ray Fohr  a Chevron spokesman  said the San Ramon  California based oil major is focused on its  base business  in Venezuela and is in full compliance with the law  He said PDVSA directs work processes in the area where the upgrader is located   including decisions made regarding the use of light oil and plant stops and restarts  
Overall  Chevron had a production decline in 2019 compared with 2018  he said   If Chevron is forced to leave Venezuela   he wrote   non U S  companies will fill the void and oil production will continue   He declined to address specifics on the upgrader 
The waiver debate is complex  according to Control Risks  Gallegos  the author of a book on Venezuela s oil industry   If you do away with waivers  it doesn t immediately mean oil production goes down and Maduro is out   he said in an interview   The primary concern of the U S  is the interests of oil companies  and access to the resource  ",2020-02-11,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chevron-boosts-venezuela-oil-output-while-us-is-eyeing-new-sanctions-2081261,2081261
244762,INTC,EU seeks to expedite police requests for data from tech firms,news,"By Julia Fioretti BRUSSELS  Reuters    The European Union wants to make it easier for law enforcement authorities to get electronic evidence directly from tech companies  such as  Facebook Inc   O FB  and Alphabet Inc s  O GOOGL  Google  even when stored in another European country  In the wake of the deadly Islamist inspired attacks in Europe over the past two years  tech companies have come under increased pressure to do more to help police investigations  and law enforcement officials have bemoaned the slow process required to access data stored in the cloud in other EU member states  The European Commission will present three options to EU ministers which will form the basis of a future legislative proposal  including the possibility for police to copy data directly from the cloud  EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova told Reuters on Wednesday   I am sure that now in the shadow of the recent terrorist attacks and increasing threats in Europe there will be more understanding among the ministers  even among those who come from countries where there has not been a terrorist attack   she said  EU justice ministers meet in Luxembourg on Thursday and will discuss the Commission s options  Based on their preferences  the EU executive will then come forward with a proposal by the end of the year or early 2018  Jourova said  The least intrusive option involves allowing law enforcement authorities in one member state to ask an IT provider in another member state to turn over electronic evidence  without having to ask that member state first  The second option would see the companies obliged to turn over data if requested by law enforcement authorities in other member countries  As an example  police in Italy seeking electronic evidence stored in Ireland would currently have to ask the Irish authorities to retrieve the evidence for them  a process critics say is slow and cumbersome  However  many in the tech community have voiced concern about allowing governments to force companies to turn over data stored in another country  fearing it could erode customers  privacy and make them less likely to use cloud services if they thought the data could be seized   Microsoft Corp   O MSFT  fought and won a high profile battle in the United States against the Department of Justice s request that it turn over emails stored on a server in Ireland  The Commission weighed in for Microsoft in that case  saying data held by companies in the EU should not be directly accessed by foreign authorities outside formal channels of cooperation  BSA  representing major software companies including Intel  O INTC   Microsoft and Oracle  N ORCL   urged the EU to provide clarity and predictability for businesses   We urge EU legislators to pursue measures that guarantee clarity and predictability  without putting service providers in  conflict of law  situations   said Thomas Boue  director general for policy  EMEA  The most intrusive option being considered by the EU could be envisaged in situations where authorities do not know the location of the server hosting the data or there is a risk of the data being lost  Jourova said   This third option is kind of an emergency possibility which will require some additional safeguards protecting the privacy of people   she said  Such safeguards include requiring that law enforcement requests are necessary and proportionate   You simply cannot massively collect some digital data for some future use   Jourova said  The types of data that could fall within the scope of the law will also be discussed on Thursday  with options ranging from non content data such as location or traffic data to personal communications data  
 My preference is to go for this as an extraordinary measure for extraordinary threats  for high gravity criminal offences such as terrorism and there I am in favor of enabling the use of personal data   Jourova said  adding that no decision has yet been taken ",2017-06-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/eu-seeks-to-expedite-police-requests-for-data-from-tech-firms-493139,493139
394774,IBM,IBM Looks Good In That Red Hat,news,"Computing titan International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  announced its latest results Tuesday evening  The report  which covered the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  edged out analyst expectations across the board and IBM s shares posted a modest gain in after hours trading 
IBM s fourth quarter results by the numbers

Data source  IBM  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles 
Big Blue s adjusted earnings fell while the underlying GAAP net profit nearly doubled  The non GAAP results backed out a  1 9 billion tax benefit from the year ago period that was scaled down to a mere  14 million in this report 
The entire income statement also carries contributions from Linux vendor Red Hat  which IBM acquired in a blockbuster  33 billion deal that closed last summer  Red Hat reported fourth quarter earnings of  1 07 billion  up from  863 million in the comparable year ago period as a separate company  The company is now included in IBM s cloud and cognitive software division  which posted 9  year over year revenue growth to  7 2 billion 
A fresh generation of System Z mainframe computers lifted IBM s systems hardware sales 18  higher  Power server sales fell 23  while System Z orders surged 63  higher 
Debt service
IBM is known for its desire to send its cash flow back to shareholders through a combination of generous dividends and substantial share buybacks  That s still a long term ambition for Big Blue  but the company is tapping the brakes on its stock buybacks for a couple of years in order to pay down the debt that was used for financing the Red Hat acquisition 
On that note  IBM generated  6 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter and funneled  1 4 billion of that into dividend payouts  Another  3 4 billion was invested in accelerated debt repayments  Management hopes to complete the Red Hat related debt service by the end of 2021  restoring IBM s damaged credit ratings to a higher level investment grade 

What s next for IBM 
Looking ahead  IBM s management expects GAAP earnings to rise in fiscal year 2020  compared to  10 57 per share in the just completed year  Adjusted earnings should land north of  13 35 per share  implying at least 4  year over year growth  Free cash flow should also increase by roughly 4   landing near  12 5 billion 
 With this trajectory  in 2020  we expect to grow revenue  operating earnings per share  and free cash flow  and expand operating gross margin   CFO Jim Kavanaugh said in the earnings call   Within that  we ll maintain a high level of investment focused on hybrid cloud and data and AI capabilities  we ll drive productivity and take structural actions  especially in our  Global Technology Services  business  And remember  we ll continue to face year to year headwinds from the divested businesses  especially in the first half  and our P L will also still have an impact from the Red Hat non cash purchase accounting adjustments  though less than 2019  
This version of Big Blue  with Red Hat front and center  is finally on track to deliver on the cloud based strategic shift that started eight years ago  though it s happening while also paying down the massive debt that came with the Red Hat deal  Nothing is ever easy in this rapidly changing tech industry  That being said  I still like IBM as a long term wealth creator that marries a perennially undervalued stock    the shares are trading at just 10 9 times trailing earnings    to a bountiful 4 7  dividend yield  It s a great buy for patient investors ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plee5,2065023

BlackRock Inc  NYSE BLK   started higher in February  with an initial run that found resistance in April at 365  It built an expanding wedge over the next 3 and a half months  With a failed break down along the way  before pushing to a new higher high in August  That led to some consolidation as well for 2 months before another break down  This one was to a higher low  but both break downs pierced the 200 day SMA before reversing higher 
The last leg higher found resistance at the prior high and consolidated again for a couple of weeks  Thursday last week it pushed to a new high but reversed back into consolidation Friday  Where will it go from here  Momentum indicators are not telling  The RSI is in the bullish zone but moving sideways  The MACD is flat but crossed down  Bullish but possibly turning  The Bollinger Bands  are starting to squeeze  This could go either way 
A Measured Move to the upside would give a target to 403  But failure and a push lower could go all the way to 340 without breaking the long term uptrend  There is resistance at 377 and then free air higher  Support lower comes at 365 and 360 followed by and 351 before 337  Short interest is low at 1 5   and the company is expected to report earnings next on January 12th

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into the last month of the year sees the equity markets retrenching from their post election moves  with shallow pullbacks at this point 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its downtrend while Crude Oil moves higher  The US Dollar Index continues to mark time  moving sideways  while US Treasuries are biased to continue lower  The Shanghai Composite is on a trend higher that looks to continue while Emerging Markets consolidate at resistance with a bias to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain low keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts are mixed again  with the longer timeframe better for all 3  but the shorter timeframe showing weakness  All 3 ended the week with indecision candles though so the retrenchment may end soon  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

441596,WFC,FOREX Euro skids vs dollar  but losses seen limited,news,"  Euro dips as German official casts doubt on Greece aid
   Euro stays near 1 month high vs dollar on rate outlook
   ECB set to signal July rate hike  dollar sentiment weak
  Updates prices  adds Juncker comments 
 By Gertrude Chavez Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK  June 6  Reuters    The euro faltered on Monday
after two days of gains  pressured by a German official s
comment that a second Greek bailout was not yet certain 
although belief that Greece will be able to avert default on
its massive debt should limit the currency s losses 
 Jean Claude Juncker  chairman of the euro zone finance
ministers  further fueled selling in the euro in the afternoon
session when he said the currency was overvalued  He made the
comment before the European Parliament s economic committee in
Strasbourg  France  See  ID nBRU011530  
 Policymakers have inched toward a new bailout package for
Greece that German media said could exceed 100 billion euros 
 That helped push the euro to a one month high of  1 46590
early in the session on trading platform EBS  But the euro
slipped after a spokesman for the German finance ministry said
a second aid program was not certain and after Juncker made his
valuation remarks  The euro was last down 0 5 percent at
 1 45650  
 Greece received a 110 billion euro aid package a year ago 
 For more see  ID nB4E7GU00T  and  ID LDE7551RS  
 However  traders said the market expects to see a deal that
gives Greece more time to repay its debt 
  We re seeing a bit of a corrective pullback in the euro
after gains last week and in general the euro remains sensitive
to headlines on Greece   said Vassili Serebriakov  currency
strategist at Wells Fargo in New York 
  There are a lot of moving parts and a lot of details to
fine tune on Greece s second aid plan  but overall  I see
everything working out  It is clear that the EU won t allow
Greece to fail  
 Eurogroup chairman Juncker said as much on Monday  saying
everything should be done to save Greece  See  ID nBRU011531  
 Investors are also looking to Thursday s European Central
Bank meeting  at which ECB President Jean Claude Trichet is
expected to hint at a July interest rate hike 
  The focus will turn toward interest rate differentials 
and with the Federal Reserve unlikely to do anything this year 
an ECB rate hike will pull money toward the euro and other
currencies   said Boris Schlossberg  director of FX research at
GFT Forex   There s no reason whatsoever to own dollars now  
 If Trichet hints at a July rate hike by talking tough on
inflation  Schlossberg said the euro could retest a 2011 high
around  1 4940 
 Trichet  speaking in Montreal  added to the market s
hawkish view on euro zone interest rates by reiterating the
need to prevent commodity price increases from triggering
second round effects on inflation   ID nN06286699  
 For now  options barriers were stacked around  1 47000 
traders said  with resistance also seen at  1 47100    the 76 4
percent retracement of the euro s May decline 
 Some currency portfolio managers have also shifted back
toward a long euro position in the latest week  according to
Quaesta Capital  a  3 5 billion fund of funds based in Zurich 
Switzerland 
 The dollar hit a one month low beneath 80 yen before
rebounding to 80 130 yen   down about 0 2 percent  Asian
sovereigns were said to be dollar buyers below the 80 level 
 Commodity currencies also benefited from weakness in the
greenback  The Australian dollar traded at US 1 0700  
near Friday s 3 1 2 week high of US 1 0775 
 The dollar index  dipped as low as 73 643    a trough
not seen since May 5  A recent spate of soft U S  data has
raised concerns about the strength of the U S  economy  A
report Friday showed a sharp slowdown in job creation  pushing
the unemployment rate up to 9 1 percent   ID nOAT004818 
 But by late afternoon  the dollar index was up 0 3 percent
at 74 015 
 With the Fed not likely to lift interest rates for some
time  investors should continue to short the dollar 
 especially against capacity constrained  rising interest rate
currencies like the Indian rupee  and Brazilian real

307807,BA,Exclusive  Boeing says it has no plans for long range 737 MAX,news,"By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE  Reuters    Boeing Co has no plans to extend the range of its forthcoming 737 MAX 9 jetliner in response to Airbus Group s move to offer a long range version of its competing A321 aircraft  a senior Boeing executive said on Thursday 
 We are very happy with where the MAX 9 sits and feel the competition is simply doing things to catch up with it   Randy Tinseth  vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes  said in an interview 
Last month  Airbus said it would add fuel tanks to the A321neo to increase its range  targeting a market niche left open by the out of production Boeing 757  Airbus said the plane s range would be about 100 nautical miles more than that of the 757 200W 
The market for these single aisle aircraft is crucial for both companies  as it will account for nearly 70 percent of new aircraft deliveries worth some  2 5 trillion over the next 20 years  according to Boeing s estimates 
Airbus recently said demand for the larger A321 model is prompting it to start its production on U S  soil with that model instead of the A320 as originally planned 
Some airlines have been  upgauging  to larger jets to lower per seat costs  The 321 seats about 185 passengers in a two class configuration  compared with 150 for the A320 
Boeing said it sees the single aisle market centered around planes with 160 seats in a two class configuration  about the size of the 737 MAX 8  The larger MAX 9 carries about 180 passengers in two classes 
Tinseth said Boeing can already put an additional fuel tank on the 737 MAX 9  But the company does not see a business case in making an extended range version of the plane 
 Anything that you look at in that market segment to increase the range of that airplane  I think it would come with small returns   he said 

Boeing s chief executive officer  Jim McNerney  said earlier this month that the company would bring out a 737 MAX replacement around 2030  with a new fuselage  wings and engines  That plane will also address the gap left by the 757

338909,BFb,Company Notes Digest,opinion,"Each week we read dozens of transcripts from earnings calls and presentations as part of our investment process  Below is a weekly post which contains some of the most important quotes about the economy and industry trends from those transcripts  
The Macro Outlook 
We re all watching the market s gyrations
 we are not immune to a further deterioration in the global economy  So  like all I view  we are anxiously watching the market gyrations over the last two weeks  particularly in the emerging markets      Liquor 
There s more uncertainty than there was a couple of weeks ago
 I think it s more the uncertainty around what might occur going forward as a result of just the skittishness that we have seen over the last  I mean  literally week to ten days we are acting a little bit more I think to just the recency of some of these market sell off      Liquor 
It s way too early to tell if there s been any impact on the real economy
 What s going on lately  it s too early to tell  It s too early to read anything into it over the last couple of weeks  We re obviously keeping a very close eye on it  but most of our international buyers are Asian American  been here for generations  not impacted by their home country economy And that buyer seems quite confident and ready and able to buy  But we re obviously  as everyone is  keeping a very close eye on it  But right now it s just too early to tell you much more than that      Homebuilder 
And it s impossible to quantify any impact anyways
 With regard to recent news from China in the same way that it s not possible to quantify the positive wealth effect from a rising stock market on our sales growth there in the past couple of years  It s similarly difficult to predict any potential negative effect on sales in magnitude or duration from their recent stock market correction or currency devaluation      Jewelry 
But you can t help but be a little more conservative about how you run your business
 The challenge is   trying to operate that business is  trying to get beyond a lot of the noise that s going on from the stock market point of view and where we see the business moving and going  So you can t help  but look at that business and be a little bit more conservative about how we project that business out both through the balance of this year and then moving into 2016 and beyond  So it just gives us pause      Apparel 
Alternatively  you could just try to tune out the noise
 I would just like to address the fact that there is a lot of noise really out there right now around the apparel sector  And just so you know my perspective  I shut it out because from where I sit across all of our businesses  our job is to deliver regardless of the noise that s out there today and what I see is  I see a consumer who has confidence  I see dollars being spent and I see an opportunity for us to continue to get more than our fair share  as I look forward and I am very optimistic     Apparel 
But people are concerned about deflation
 We re looking at continued deflationary pressures  as those have mounted as we progress through the year  We re looking at a more challenging macro environment      Grocery 
And deflation makes it hard to drive revenue growth
 the challenge  the biggest challenge we re looking at is  how aggressive to raise prices particularly in a world  as you look out there that is facing extraordinary deflationary pressure in just general terms across a   the ways most economists speak  the biggest concern is deflation  not inflation     Apparel 
On top of that  as we enter the final third of the year hedges are rolling off  which will impact earnings
 The six point gap between as reported and constant currency revenue performance is wider than prior quarters  as the financial hedges are rolling off      Technology 
International 
The Bank of Canada has cut interest rates twice this year
 in the recent months  we have seen mixed economic data and weaker than anticipated growth which led The Bank of Canada to cut interest rates for a second time this year      Bank 
A weak Euro is boosting European tourism
 our Chinese consumer or Asia consumer instead of being in the United States is more so in Europe  And as you   I was in Paris and I was in Amsterdam this last month  you could see the tourism boom that s going on there and helping their economy      Apparel 
It may be boosting the whole economy
 Europe  It has gone through some macro issues  but we re actually seeing positive sales trends in Europe  We believe that economy is coming back and that consumer is re engaging      Apparel 
For what it s worth  a Chinese Real Estate broker says that the property market is warming up
 As expected the overall Chinese property market started to warm up since the end of March driven in part by the governments loosened credit policies and purchasing restrictions in certain cities  Despite recent Chinese Stock Market volatility the real estate sector has stayed relatively stable so far      Chinese Real Estate Broker 
Financials 
Brokerage firms are probably cleaning up in this environment
 In the equities trading side of the business  it s really just agency trading  We are not really putting capital to work for to offer liquidity  So the equities trading business has actually been as you might imagine reasonably robust especially over the last several days     Bank 
These markets make it harder for high yield companies to issue debt
 I can start with the trading conditions currently  I think starting with fixed income  we are seeing because of the recent market volatility high yield for instance in the U S  new issue flows is down  investment grade credit is steady but down a little bit  and in rates trading I would say it hasn t changed      Bank 
It sounds like mortgage markets have opened up though
 Our buyers remain to be strong  We have on the margin  a few people that struggle to qualify  but overall  we re able to get the vast majority of our people into a mortgage if they want one  We re not seeing any issue at all  really  on a macro sense with qualifying for loans Actually  today  the jumbo rate is below the conforming rate  which is pretty astounding      Homebuilder 
Insurance companies are getting into mortgage underwriting
 We believe we re going to introduce a  for the first time in our history  direct sales to a major insurance company  which will be huge  So   and that also  by the way  is going to open up financing for foreign nationals but to a greater degree than we have today  So  I don t see any issues at the moment in terms of availability or liquidity in either the conforming or the jumbo market      Homebuilder 
America s Car Mart saw an increase in credit losses  but blamed their own execution
 Bottom line results for this quarter were obviously disappointing  Sales were very solid and we re pleased with that aspect  Credit losses however were not  And we re not pleased with our results it is apparent to us that for these stores  this was primarily an execution issue      Used Car Dealer 
Royal Bank of Canada has seen a slight uptick in delinquencies in oil exposed provinces
 Delinquencies remain near historical lows and we have not seen an increase in delinquencies for Canada as a whole but have noticed a slight uptick this quarter in oil exposed provinces  This increase is insignificant at this point and it s too early to say that this is a trend      Bank 
The Texas economy still seems to be holding up though
 Texas  overall  has consistently been a good performer for us  In the second quarter and year to date  it s performed above the chain average for us  So it continues to be one of our best performing regions      Off Price Retail 
Consumer 
A late labor day is making it difficult to get a clean read on consumer spending
 the calendar shift has caused a little angst probably out there with the consumer  only from the standpoint that Labor Day has been pushed back a week  as you know  And most states with schools  they sort of key off of that Labor Day date  So in a lot of cases what we ve seen is that the back to school has been pushed back in the calendar a little bit      Retail 
Poor results from retailers could lead to a more promotional environment
 we expect the retail landscape to be highly promotional during the fall season  especially given the recent results from other retailers mixed results and   actually weak results from the department stores forces us to think that the environment which is already fairly promotional will continue to be pretty promotional in the back half some retailers are going in to fall with high inventory levels       Off Price Retail 
Gap is introducing some fast fashion capabilities to its stores
 For the first time  we will be going to in season open in some of our key product programs and therefore able to get back in after we read the business in season with significant quantities of units  This is obviously an important capability for us  We are building this across the entire company     Apparel 
Denim may have hit bottom
 we are pretty confident that the Denim cycle has hit bottom and it has been coming back over the last several months      Apparel 
Williams Sonoma is still working out kinks from the port disruption earlier this year
 while the port disruption was extremely difficult  the good news is that  it caused us to reexamine every single element of our supply chain  And we have identified significant opportunities to improve service levels and over time drive down costs      Home Goods 
Technology 
Best Buy sees continued strong demand for consumer electronics
 Our first observation is that overall consumer demand for technology products and services including appliances and mobile phones is growing  This growth is driven by technology and product innovation and by micro factors such as population growth  the housing recovery and healthy living trends that are driving momentum in our appliance  home theater  connected homes and health and wearables business  which  we believe  will remain positive catalyst in quarters to come      Electronics Retailer 
The cadence of the Windows 10 rollout posed challenges for PC OEMs
 We did anticipate a challenging operating system transition to Windows 10 on two dimensions  One was a free upgrade that was of course offered  And the second was the very short transition time  which is normally about three months  which was compressed to under one month  And what that drove was fairly high Windows 8 channel inventory levels  and that will take a little bit of time to flush      Technology

Distressed assets still aren t for sale yet in the energy space
 Well  there will be M As and there will be distressed assets and what have you  I don t see it come right now  it will come and  I think  well we will talk again in the quarter  and nothing will happen now in the quarter      Offshore Driller 
John Deere is expecting farm receipts to be down again next year
 Looking ahead to next year  based on our expectation of above trend yield   above trend line yields for 2015 and declining livestock prices  our very early forecast calls for total cash receipts to be down slightly in 2016      Farm Equipment 
El Nino could cause some swings in growing conditions around the world
 Keep in mind as we go into 2016  we did have some favorable weather conditions  El Nino actually strengthened through the summer  And that certainly bodes well normally for U S  market or growing areas  But keep in mind that can have some more negative and dry impact on other parts of the world      Farm Equipment

381323,NWSA,Shock And Anger Over Eurozone Ministers  Willie Suttonomics,opinion,I am sure that the Eurozone finance ministers have never heard of Willie Sutton  But they are engaging now in Willie Suttonomics  Willie Sutton was the bank robber from the early part of the 20th century who  when asked why he robbed banks  reputedly answered  because that s where the money is   This weekend  the Troika agreed to extend a critical loan to Cyprus in order to stave off a default for the small Eurozone nation  The  10bln loan was extended on condition that bank depositors be levied 6 75  or 9 9  of their deposits  the lesser amount if under  100 000  as part of the solution  and the new president of Cyprus  he was given no choice  I fail to see how this differs from what Willie Sutton did  except that Sutton at least went to prison   multiple times   for the crime  You went into the bank on Thursday and your deposits read  20 000 as you were saving for a new car  or a house  or college  on Monday  you have  18 650  It is being called  disingenuously  a  tax   but considering that no Cypriot body approved the  tax  it is hard to see how that appellation fits  The money vanished from the vault with no warning  That seems more like a bank robber s job except that ordinarily  when a bank is robbed the depositors are protected  The depositors would have been better off if the money had been stolen by Willie Sutton  My son  who is 9 years old  saw it the same way when I explained the basic facts of what happened to the depositors  He said  that sounds like something Lex Luthor would do   From the mouths of children and I don t judge him wrong on this  On Monday  I imagine that markets will try and behave as if this  puts the crisis behind us  again  But also on Monday  I imagine that every corporate Treasurer who has money in a bank in Europe will be trying to diversify those deposits to other jurisdictions  Perhaps  if I am such a treasurer  I will pull money from Italy to put into Germany or perhaps I will put it into UK or US banks  But one thing I certainly will not do is leave all of it in a bank in Italy  or Portugal  or Hungary  or Spain  It is possible that nothing will happen  or at least not right away as stunned European depositors wait to find out if it s really true  and some dwell in denial  But it s also possible that we could see the mother of all bank runs  because it s no longer necessary for depositors to stand in long lines to withdraw their cash  as happened in every major banking crisis that happened before deposit insurance  This is exactly the opposite of deposit insurance   instead of the government protecting depositors  the government is opening the vault for the robbers  Now  it s not completely approved as of this writing    the Cypriot parliament will vote on Sunday whether to mug depositors for the levy  But  since the alternative is that Cyprus will have to default on Tuesday  the odds are good that either they ll approve the levy  which banks have already sequestered  without any law to tell them to do so   or there will be some 11th hour brinkmanship with the Troika and Cyprus on Monday  But by Tuesday  you will either have the disorderly default of a Eurozone member  or confiscation of deposits held in banks of a Eurozone country  Now that s a Hobson s choice if ever there was one  Here are some stories elsewhere about the crazy Troika scheme      and   And I rarely cite Zerohedge but  of some quotes from well placed individuals in Europe  Comfortingly  the response so far has been shock and anger  Most observers are  rightly  dismissing the soothing statements that this action is an  exception   Yes  it is   a confiscatory exception  and one that was completely random and unforeseeable by the depositors  Does it make one feel better that the crazy man on the street just set his neighbor s car on fire  if he says  but it s just his car   no one else s   No  because you know he s a crazy man  and now you know there is nothing he won t do  Random injustice is worse than systematic injustice  Hold on to your assets  folks   I have no idea what happens on Monday but I have a feeling it will require more liquidity  But then  doesn t everything these days ,2013-03-17,Michael Ashton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/shock-and-anger-over-eurozone-ministers'-willie-suttonomics-159184,159184

5 Top Ranked Stocks with Impressive Sales Growth to Bet On 

	With the Q1 reporting cycle in full swing  everyone must be looking forward to earnings performance  But one should keep in mind that solid sales growth is one of the major factors for the long term success of any company 

	Continuous growth in sales holds the key to survival of any business  For any company  sales growth not only provides an insight into product demand and pricing power  it is important for growth projections and strategic decision making 
	However  individual investors often fail to take into account sales growth as a dependable metric  This could be because of investors  preconceived notion that a company s stock price is generally sensitive to its earnings momentum 
	Nevertheless  it should be kept in mind that in case a company incurs a loss  albeit temporarily   it is valued on its revenues as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance 
	Also  in an improving economy  the absence of sales growth indicates that the company s market share is not increasing  So  some sustained sales growth is required to support the bottom line 
	Therefore  Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be a suitable metric for stock valuation  The importance of the metric lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings 
	However  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits  Hence  it s more prudent to consider a company s cash position along with its sales number  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Picking the Winners
	In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters 
	But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry   Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
	Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening Morgan Stanley  NYSE       provides various financial products and services  This New York based company currently has long term expected earnings per share  EPS  growth rate of 13 20  and carries a Zacks Rank  2 Constellation Brands  Inc   NYSE        based in Victor  NY  produces  imports  and markets beer  wine  and spirits  It has long term expected EPS growth rate of 17 80   The company sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see   
	Headquartered in Auburn Hills  MI  BorgWarner Inc   NYSE        provides solutions for combustion  hybrid  and electric vehicles worldwide  The company currently has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 8 60  and a Zacks Rank  2 Western Digital Corporation  NASDAQ        based in Irvine  CA  develops  manufactures  and sells data storage devices and solutions  The company has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 12 10  and sports a Zacks Rank  1 AMETEK  Inc   NYSE       manufactures electronic instruments and electromechanical devices  This Berwyn  PA based company has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 11  and carries a Zacks Rank  2

267673,XOM,Economic Calendar   Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,news,"Investing com   After another turbulent week of trading worldwide  there s a lot to keep investors on edge in the week ahead 
Market focus will be largely attuned to another batch of earnings results  with names like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  both set to report in the coming days 
Those names follow a string of tech earnings that have been largely disappointing  Weaker than expected results from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  last week exacerbated investors  worries about the dominance of tech stocks in this market cycle 
Besides earnings  the monthly U S  jobs report  which is expected to remain in territory consistent with a strengthening labor market  will be the biggest economic data point of the week 
Investors will also be bracing for any news out of the political sphere  as the U S  midterm elections   due in November   draw closer 
Across the Atlantic  traders will focus on flash euro zone inflation figures  which are likely to lend support to the European Centrals Bank s decision not to rush stimulus withdrawal 
On the central bank front  monetary policy announcements from the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan will also be on the agenda  though it s highly unlikely either will rock the boat policy wise 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets 
1  Apple Highlights Last Big Week of Q3 Earnings
About a quarter of S P 500 companies report in what will be the last big week for third quarter earnings on Wall Street 
Apple will get the most attention when it releases results Thursday after the closing bell  The world s largest company by market cap is expected to report adjusted earnings of  2 78 per share on revenue of  61 43 billion  In addition to those top  and bottom line numbers  investors will be paying close attention to iPhone unit sales  Growth in Apple s services business will also be in focus 
Some of the other high profile names reporting in the week ahead include Mondelez  NASDAQ MDLZ  on Monday  Facebook  eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU    General Electric   NYSE GE   Mastercard  NYSE MA   Coca Cola  NYSE KO    Under Armour   NYSE UAA   and  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  on Tuesday  General Motors  NYSE GM   Sprint  NYSE S   and Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM  on Wednesday  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   Teva  NYSE TEVA   Spotify  NYSE SPOT   DowDuPont  NYSE DWDP   and GoPro  NASDAQ GPRO  on Thursday  and  Exxon Mobil   NYSE XOM  and  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  on Friday 



2  U S  Jobs Report
The U S  Labor Department will release the nonfarm payrolls report for October at 8 30AM ET on Friday  The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 191 000  after adding 134 000 positions in September  while the unemployment rate is seen inching up to 3 8  from 3 7  
However  most of the focus will likely be on average hourly earnings figures  which are expected to rise 3 1  from a year earlier  a tad quicker than the 2 8  increase a month earlier 
A report on U S  personal income and spending  which includes personal consumption expenditures  PCE  inflation figures  the Fed s preferred metric for inflation  will also capture the market s attention 
Other top tier economic data due this week includes ADP private sector payrolls  CB consumer confidence  car sales  trade figures  construction spending and the ISM survey on manufacturing sector activity 
Data released last week showed the U S  economy grew at a 3 5  annualized rate  keeping growth on track to hit the Trump administration s 3  target this year 
The Federal Reserve remains on course to raise interest rates again in December  despite a recent tightening in financial market conditions brought about by a stock market sell off and a rise in U S  Treasury yields 
3  Euro Zone Flash Inflation
The euro zone will publish flash inflation figures for October at 5 00AM ET on Wednesday  The consensus forecast is that the report will show consumer prices rose 2 1   unchanged from the preceding month  The core figure  without volatile energy and food prices  is seen inching up to 1 0  from 0 9  
Germany  France  Italy and Spain will produce their own CPI reports throughout the week 
Besides inflation  the euro zone will publish flash third quarter GDP data on Tuesday  which is expected to confirm that growth in the single currency bloc has moderated since the start of the year 
Last week  the European Central Bank confirmed plans to wind down its massive stimulus program by year end and raise interest rates sometime after next summer  even amid mounting signs that the euro zone economy is wilting under global pressures 
4  Bank of England Policy Announcement
The Bank of England is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold and say it is sticking to its plan to raise them gradually when it meets this week  A decision is due at 8 00AM ET on Thursday 
BoE Governor Mark Carney will hold a press conference shortly after the announcement  and investors will monitor his language for signals on what the appetite is for hikes through the end of the year and beyond 
Most economists think the British central bank will wait until May 2019 to raise rates again  assuming Britain leaves the European Union with a deal 
Political headlines will also be in focus as investors watch developments surrounding ongoing Brexit negotiations  With less than five months until Britain leaves the EU  the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels  as Prime Minister Theresa May s Conservative party remains split on how close the country should remain to the bloc 
Also on the agenda  UK finance minister Philip Hammond will present his budget to parliament on Monday  Hammond is under pressure from Prime Minister May to end a decade of austerity to see off a rise in popularity of the opposition Labour Party 
5  Bank of Japan Policy Meeting 
The Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep its short term interest rate target at minus 0 1  and the 10 year government bond yield target at around zero percent at the conclusion of its two day meeting on Wednesday 
Media reports over the weekend indicated that the BoJ will consider making a slight change to the timing of its government debt purchases to encourage more trading activity between financial institutions  The central bank may also consider reducing the frequency of its purchases of mid  and long term debt  reports said 
The changes  although small  would be the latest sign Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is gradually walking away from his radical stimulus program deployed five years ago to shock the public out of a sticky deflationary mindset 
After half a decade of heavy money printing failed to fire up inflation  the BoJ is under pressure to address the rising cost of prolonged easing  such as the hit to bank profits from near zero rates  which would require raising rates

Two days ago  says StreetInsider com     or maybe it was only yesterday  says TheFly com     analysts at Edward Jones upgraded shares of IBM  NYSE IBM  from  hold  to  buy   Whenever the upgrade actually happened  details on what it contained only began filtering out this morning    and it seems investors really like reading those details 
After rising 1 8  on Monday  and a further 1 9  on Tuesday  IBM shares were shooting ahead a full 5  as of 1 p m  EST today 

So what
So what are the details on this one  As TheFly reports  Edward Jones  upgrade is based primarily on the fact that IBM CEO Ginni Rometty is stepping down as CEO and Arvind Krishna is stepping up to take her place 
Curiously  these are the exact same details that sparked a 5  rally in IBM stock last week  which may not say much about investors  attention spans  Granted  Edward Jones also added that this change in management is a  positive catalyst  for the stock    but anyone who s paid attention as IBM stock lost 22  of its market cap during Rometty s tenure could have told you that 
Now what
If there s one bit of information in this upgrade that may be worth paying more attention to  it s Edward Jones  observation that IBM shares look attractively valued    but even here  I fear I must quibble 
Objectively speaking  IBM s price to earnings ratio of 14 8 may make it look like something of a value stock  and IBM s fat 4 5  dividend yield certainly makes it a viable candidate for a good dividend stock   Yet most analysts still think IBM will only grow its earnings at about 6 4  annually over the next five years  Whatever Edward Jones may believe  the idea of paying a double digit multiple for single digit growth still doesn t look like a very good way to make money 
To become a real  buy   IBM simply must grow faster ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prk70,2077118

256113,CMG,5 Stocks To Dump Ahead Of Q2 Earnings Season,opinion,"First quarter earnings season is coming to an end and the earnings recession still deeply entrenched in the market s memory  Almost all S P 500 companies have reported and results have been largely disappointing 
This marked the first time the S P 500 recorded four consecutive quarters of year over year declines in earnings since 2009  Unfortunately  Q2 is shaping up to be another slow period for America s biggest companies including Chipotle      Gap     Apple     Alcoa    and Gilead Sciences    
According to the Estimize data these names have been on the move  as witnessed by negative year over year growth estimates  heavy downward revisions and a history of missing expectations  The combination of these factors have typically led to a significant underperformance in each of the stocks 


1  Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG 
Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure
The food safety and health scares that closed out 2015 have really put a damper on Chipotle s earnings  Financial performance of CMG has dipped along with the traffic  with many consumers not ready to return to the burrito chain in the wake of the E coli and norovirus cases 
The first quarter of 2016 featured declines in every key metric  revenue decreased 23 4   comparable sales down 29 7  and operating margins slide 27 5   It hasn t helped that food prices such as chicken and beef have been rising while Chipotle also continues to raise wages for its in store employees  As the company continues its gradual path to recovery  it s safe to say that it won t be fully realized this quarter 
The Estimize community is down on Chipotle heading into its Q2 earnings  The consensus data is calling for earnings per share of  1 12 on  1 03 billion in revenue  Compared to a year earlier  this reflects a 70  decline on the bottom line and 12  on the top  In the last 3 months per share estimates have declined 65  with revenue falling 16   Estimates should continue to fall as we near Chipotle s July report date  All of these troubles have no doubt hurt shareholders  Shares are down nearly 40  since news broke of the first health scare 

2  Gap  NYSE GPS  
Consumer Discretionary   Specialty Retail
Weak consumer spending for apparel and accessories has been a consistent trend that has been affecting certain retailers  the Gap included  Prior to its Q1 report  management warned that earnings would significantly miss expectations and  no surprise  they did  Earnings of 32 cents per share fell short of the Estimize consensus data by 12 cents  recording a drop of 41  from a year earlier 
Weaker traffic and higher levels of inventory put pressure on the bottom line  This marked the fifth consecutive quarter that both earnings and revenue declined  The Gap s core brands have all struggled in this time period  with Banana Republic stores faring the worst 
Competitive pressures and the emergence of fast fashion have also played a role in Gap s dwindling growth  The Estimize community is already predicting another weak quarter  The consensus is calling for earnings per share of 46 cents on  3 69 billion in revenue  Profits are expected to contract 25  on a year over year basis with revenue down 4  over the same time frame  Per share estimates have been cut 22  since its last report  reflecting analysts  negative sentiment towards the company 

3  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  
Consumer Discretionary   Computers   Peripherals
A long held favorite on Wall Street  Apple has hit a few bumps in the last 6 months  The iPhone has been at the core of its problems 
Last quarter marked the first time Apple reported negative revenue growth in 13 years  thanks to slowing iPhone trends  It s already expected that these trends should continue to be a problem for 2016 and perhaps 2017 
Things are only getting worse for Apple  when earlier this year major iPhone suppliers guided lower on fiscal year expectations  and just this week Apple announced its shift to a 3 year iPhone product cycle  The iPhone is a cash cow for Apple  accounting for two thirds of sales in a given year  Apple s over reliance and now demise of the iPhone puts the stock in an uncertain situation 
In the past 12 months  shares have slid 25 4  with no sign of recovering until the iPhone 7 is released  Just last week  Goldman Sachs  cut its price target for Apple on negative sentiment towards the company s lack of innovation and sluggish earnings  Consequently  the Estimize community believes this will be another disappointing quarter  The consensus data is looking for earnings per share of  1 46 on  42 47 billion in revenue reflecting double digit declines on both the top and bottom line  Analysts have revised estimates down nearly 24  in the past 3 months and should continue to fall in the run up to its July report date 
 4  Alcoa  NYSE AA 
Materials   Metals   Mining
Earnings season doesn t officially kick off until metals and mining giant  Alcoa  reports results  Earnings have underperformed lately with Q1 marking the third consecutive period that both profits and revenue declined 
Alcoa is not alone however  The industrials sector in the United States have suffered in recent years  driven by a strong U S  dollar  volatile oil prices and overall economic weakness  Alcoa felt the impact of this last quarter  particularly in its international markets 
The company is guiding for declines in the range of  2 and  4  this year for its global heavy duty truck and trailer segments  They have also unveiled plans to spin its profitable assets over two new companies in an effort to boost its share value  Shares are down 25  from a year earlier with a high chance of falling further if earnings disappoint 
The Estimize consensus believes earnings this quarter will be just as bad  as evidenced by downward revisions activity  Analysts are looking for earnings per share of 9 cents on  5 27 billion in revenue  Compared to the same period last year this represents a 51  decline on the bottom line and 9  on the top  Weak comparisons have contributed to the 2  declines the stock typically sees in the 5 days following a report  Unless the economy starts to improve  the industrial sector and Alcoa will continue to hurt 
Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD 
 Health Care   Biotechnology
Healthcare is one of the most volatile industries today  A single announcement can swing a stock significantly in either direction  Gilead had been on the right side of those swings as earnings continued to rise and top expectations over the past few years  However  dismal first quarter earnings have experts believing that Gilead s success is coming to an end 
Last quarter broke a 6 quarter streak of beating on both the top and bottom line  Shares are now down 15  since the start of the year and may move lower unless investors hear some good news 
Gilead is best known for its Hepatitis C drugs  Harvoni and Solvaldi  The drugs have been very successful in the past few years but the emergence of Merck s  NYSE MRK  own hep C drug at a lower price point has started to take its toll  With a number of new drugs in the pipeline and the recent approval of its new HCV drug Epclusa  earnings should start stabilize  For now though  Q2 is expected to be just as underwhelming 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  3 04 on  7 79 billion in revenue  Compared to a year earlier  this reflects a 2  decline on the bottom line and 5  on the top  Those losses should expand as revisions activity becomes more rampant in the run up to its report date ",2016-06-09,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/don’t-get-caught-with-these-5-stocks-ahead-of-earnings-season-200134868,200134868

294465,TSLA,With Shanghai Factory  Tesla Hopes To Gain Ground In China s Electric Car Market,opinion,"According to a   electric car maker Tesla Inc    NASDAQ TSLA   reached a deal to begin building a factory in Shanghai s free trade zone  which is the first Hong Kong like free trade area in mainland China 
This particular kind of arrangement marks the first for a foreign automaker  and will allow Tesla to grow its footprint in the quickly evolving Chinese electric car industry  The WSJ notes that Tesla would still have to pay the 25  import tariff  but the company would be able to retain full control  and could offset the tariff with lower shipping and production costs 
Tesla originally confirmed that it was talking to Shanghai s government back in June about building a manufacturing facility  And apparently  CEO Elon Musk has been wanting to build a factory in China for a while now   that a locally based Chinese plant could cut production expenses by as much as a third 
While the Silicon Valley giant has been selling its electric vehicles in China for years  sales have never really taken off  as the country has pretty strict rules for foreign automakers looking to sell 
Current rules state that foreign automakers must partner with local companies and brands for domestic production  General Motors   NYSE GM   has a joint venture with Shanghai s SAIC Motor Group  for example  while Ford   NYSE F   is partnering with Chongqing based Changan Automotive  There s also the tariff mentioned above imposed by the government  as any good coming into the domestic market from a free trade zone is considered an import 
However  Chinese officials have recently considered relaxing some of these rules as the country seeks to boost its own electric vehicle market    the Chinese government debuted a new set of emission rules last month that would require all carmakers to produce zero  and low emission vehicles beginning in 2019  This  in addition to a pledge to bump up plug in hybrid and electric car sales  could be just the thing to push more Chinese consumers into buying a new Tesla 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ",2017-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/with-shanghai-factory-tesla-hopes-to-gain-ground-in-chinas-electric-car-market-200220482,200220482
333694,NTES,How To Invest In The  Asian Century ,opinion,"The 19th century belonged to the United Kingdom  the 20th century to the United States  Many market experts and analysts now speculate that the 21st century will be remembered as the  Asian Century   dominated by rising superpowers such as Indonesia  India and China 
It s those last two countries  India and China home to nearly 40 percent of the world s population that I want to focus on  Both emerging markets offer attractive investment opportunities  especially for growth investors who seek to derisk from American equities 
Look at how dramatically the two have expanded in the last half century 
As recently as 1970  neither country controlled a significant share of world gross domestic product  GDP   As of June of this year  however  China represents more than 15 percent of world GDP  India more than 3 percent  This has displaced Russia and Spain  itself the world s wealthiest economy in the 16th century 
And the expansion is expected to continue  Back in February  I shared with you research from PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC   which predicts that by 2050  China and India will become the world s number one and number two largest economies based on purchasing power parity  PPP  
 PPP  if you re unfamiliar  is a theory that states that exchange rates between two nations are equal when price levels of a fixed basket of goods and services are the same  

Also note Indonesia  which is expected to replace Japan as the fourth largest economy by midcentury 
A Surge in Middle Class Spenders What should excite investors the most is the growing size of the middle class in China and India  More middle class consumers means more spending on goods and services and more investing 
Remember  China s middle class is already larger than that found here in the U S  according to Credit Suisse  In October 2015  the investment bank reported that  for the first time  the size of China s middle class had exceeded that of America s middle class  109 million to 92 million  As incomes rise  so too does demand for durables  luxury goods  vehicles  air travel  energy and more 

Living standards have risen dramatically in China  According to Dr  Ira Kalish  a specialist in global economic issues for Deloitte  hourly wages for manufacturing jobs in China are now higher than those found in Latin American countries except for Chile  They re even nearing wages found in lower income European countries such as Greece and Portugal 
Looking ahead to 2030  China is expected to have a mind boggling 1 billion people more than three times the current U S  population enjoying a middle class lifestyle filled with middle class things  from cars to designer clothes to electronics and appliances 
India  meanwhile  will have an estimated 475 million people among its middle class ranks  The South Asian country is currently the fastest growing G20 economy  with Morgan Stanley analysts estimating year over year growth to hit 7 9 percent in December  Driving this growth is a steady increase in wages and pensions  which will support consumption of goods and services 
Demographic trends in India make the country look especially favorable  As I ve shared with you before  India has a young population with an average age of 29   The average age in China  by comparison  is around 37  while Japan s is 48   By 2020  more than 64 percent of Indians will be under the age of 35  For many years to come  therefore  India will have a much larger group of working age individuals than any other country on earth 
In fact  India s total population could now be larger than China s  according to new estimates  Yi Fuxian  a researcher at the University of Wisconsin Madison  believes China s population is much smaller than official statistics  owing to years of slower population growth under the one child policy  Yi insists that about 90 million fewer people reside in China than previously thought  meaning its 2017 population could be closer to 1 29 billion people  That would narrowly make India  home to 1 31 billion people  the world s most populous country

345189,CME,Why Inflation Futures Matter,opinion,The Chicago Mercantile Exchange  CME  is currently having discussions with market participants and is considering launching in 2013 two new futures contracts related to inflation  a Consumer Price Index  CPI  futures contract and a deliverable TIPS futures contract  My company has been an advocate for these contracts and involved in their construction  We expect to be involved in making markets in them  Our interest is therefore no doubt obvious  But are these contracts important  in a larger sense  for the market  The answer is yes  and here is why   It is a fact of financial life that most mature markets enjoy three legs of a liquidity ecosystem  cash markets  over the counter  OTC  derivatives  and exchange traded derivatives  For example  in the nominal interest rates market Treasuries provide a deep and liquid cash market  there is a large and well functioning market for LIBOR swaps  and there is efficient and transparent pricing in the futures markets as represented by Bond  Note  5 year Note  2 year Note  UltraBond  and Eurodollar contracts   The presence of three legs  rather than only one or two  in this ecosystem is important  With two legs  there are only two directions of liquidity transmission  A to B and B to A  But with three legs  there are six ways that liquidity can be transferred  A to B  A to C  B to A  B to C  C to A and C to B  By adding the third leg  the avenues of liquidity transmission aren t increased 50   but threefold   This richer liquidity ecosystem matters the most in crisis situations  such as during the credit crisis of 2008  Consider that during the crisis  credit and inflation markets became quite illiquid at times while equities  nominal rates  and commodities remained  comparatively  liquid  The main difference between these two sets is that the latter three markets all have cash  OTC  and exchange traded instruments while the former two have only two  in both cases  cash and OTC derivatives    Accordingly  while the inflation linked bond market has become truly huge  see chart below  source Barclays Capital  and the inflation linked swap market has enjoyed an almost uninterrupted rise in volumes since 2006  investors need the third component of the ecosystem  exchange traded futures contracts on inflation and or real rates  It is interesting to note that one analysis of the original CPI futures contract traded on the CSCE  many years ago  suggested that a prime cause of the contract s failing was that   the CPI futures market  unlike other futures markets  has no underlying asset which is storable or traded on an active spot market  which reduces the opportunities for arbitrageurs and speculators to participate in the market    Horrigan  B  R    The CPI Futures Market  The Inflation Hedge That Won t Grow   Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Business Review   May June 1987  3 14  Adding these products will likely increase the volumes and the liquidity of all inflation products  including  perhaps especially  the liquidity of off the run TIPS  This liquidity will also remove the main lingering concern among those investors who have not yet made meaningful investments in the market Inflation related futures are not a new idea  Since at least the 1970s  economists have anticipated that these instruments would one day be available  Several previous attempts  dating back to as early as the mid 1980s  have failed for various reasons   too early  too different  bad structure  But futures that present a different method of investing in  trading  or hedging inflation and real rate exposures are needed  not only because they create opportunities to make different sorts of trades or to trade more efficiently but also for the good of the market itself  Healthy markets in CPI futures and TIPS futures will create a better liquidity ecosystem for the entire inflation market  including for off the run TIPS bonds and seasoned inflation swaps Unfortunately  at the moment the CME appears to be afraid of launching new products that might not immediately work  It wasn t always that way   once  a CME official told me that since it cost them virtually nothing to list a contract  they favored launching lots of them and seeing what the market took to  This has changed  and the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction  Now  although many market participants are asking for these futures and there are market makers willing to make markets  the CME is deferring a decision on them until later in the year  I remain hopeful that they will launch  because they are sorely needed ,2013-04-04,Michael Ashton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-inflation-futures-matter-161676,161676

325472,CPB,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday  May 18 
1  Doubts rise over China U S  trade talks
As the U S  and China were set to continue trade talks on Friday in Washington  China poured cold water on reports that it was willing to reduce its trade surplus with the U S  by  200 billion annually by importing more American goods 
News of the offer was leaked Thursday by a Trump administration  but two posts on Chinese state social media disputed the report on Friday while a foreign ministry official said no such offer had been made to his knowledge 
In a more conciliatory tone  China did say on Friday that it is ending its anti dumping and anti subsidy investigation into imports of U S  sorghum 
The news followed words by Trump himself stating that he doubted trade talks with China would be successful   Other countries have become very spoiled  because they always got 100  of whatever they wanted from the United States   the President said in a briefing Thursday 
2  Fed speakers to be watched on data less day
With no major U S  economic reports set for release on Friday  traders will focus on a series of appearances from Federal Reserve policymakers to gauge plans on the path of rate hikes this year 
Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester focused mostly on bank regulation  warning against unwinding steps taken during the financial crisis  Mester was upbeat on the economy  saying that the outlook was as strong as it has been  in a long time  
Both Fed governor Lael Brainard and Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan will be making separate appearances at 9 15AM ET  13 15GMT  
The next rate hike is fully priced in for the June 12 13 meeting  although markets remain uncertain as to whether there will be  after the increase seen in March  a total of three or four hikes in 2018  Odds for the fourth hike in December hovered just above 50  on Friday  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
While waiting for clues from policymakers  the dollar was largely unchanged against major rivals on Friday  hovering near five month highs 
3  Oil heads for solid weekly gains ahead of data on U S  shale production
Oil headed higher in early morning trade on Friday  hovering just below 3  year intraday highs reached a day earlier  as looming sanctions against Iran  the continuing economic crisis in Venezuela and strong demand continued to support prices 
Investors looked ahead Friday to the latest weekly installment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes that will provide investors with fresh insight into U S  oil production and demand 
Data last week showed the number of U S  oil rigs rose for the sixth week in a row  fueling concerns that increased production stateside could eventually derail OPEC led efforts to curb output and balance markets 
U S  crude oil futures gained 0 28  to  71 69 at 5 55AM ET  9 55GMT   while Brent oil rose 0 52  to  79 71  off Thursday s high of  80 50 
4  U S  futures point to higher open  Dow on track for slight weekly decline
U S  futures pointed to a slightly higher open on with the Dow currently on track for weekly losses of about 0 5   Geopolitical concerns have been the main market driver this week with retail sales having been the only major economic data and while earnings season comes to a close  Deere   Company  NYSE DE  and  Campbell Soup  Company  NYSE CPB  will be among firms reporting Friday before the opening bell 
At 5 56AM ET  9 56GMT   the blue chip Dow futures gained 76 points  or 0 30   S P 500 futures rose 7 points  or 0 24   while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 19 points  or 0 28  
Elsewhere  European stocks traded lower on Friday  but dipped were still on track to pocket their eighth straight weeks of gains  supported by a rally in energy shares and a weaker euro  which helped investors shrug off worries over Italy
Earlier  Asian shares closed higher as traders appeared to take heart into China s announcement that it would end an anti dumping probe into U S  sorghum import and as bilateral trade talks moved into a second day in Washington 
5  Japanese inflation slowdown continues for 2nd month
Data released on Friday showed that Japanese inflation slowed for a second consecutive month  dropping to a 0 6  rise and missing expectations for a smaller easing to 0 7  
The latest slowdown in consumer prices will likely heighten questions about the sustainability of the Bank of Japan s stimulus program  which is widely thought to be both at the limits of its powers and producing diminishing returns 
Japan s economy contracted more than expected at the start of this year  suggesting growth has peaked after the best run of expansion in decades 
While analysts expect growth to rebound in the current quarter  any sign of the economy hitting a plateau could further push back market expectations of an exit from easy monetary policy

investors were exceptionally unimpressed  breaking down the shares by 13  as of close Wednesday  The company missed on earnings and lowered full year guidance  blaming both the trade war and economic weakness as the key catalysts  but I believe there is more to the story that isn t being mentioned FedEx IssuesFedEx cut ties with e commerce giant Amazon earlier this year saying that the business wasn t lucrative and only made up 1  of the company s total business  I believe that the implications were much more extensive than 1   Now FedEx CEO Fredrick Smith is framing the e commerce behemoth as a threat to its business Currently  Amazon controls roughly 37 7  of the US s total e commerce market  according to Business Insider  E commerce accounts for over 15  of total retail sales in the US and is expected to grow in the doubt digit percentages for the foreseeable future  Losing a sizable growing business like Amazon and turning them into a competitor is going to cause substantial headwinds for FedEx and even UPS in the future as Amazon relies more heavily on internal logistics FedEx s poorly timed acquisition of TNT Express has also been weighing heavily on the company s financials  The TNT Express purchase was meant to broaden the firm s international exposure  but it has been causing more issues than expected  The international economic slowdown along with the extensive integration costs of the TNT Express acquisition has been negatively impacting FedEx s top and bottom line FedEx has also taken price cutting measures to increase its market share  which is cutting the businesses overall margins  Management anticipates that its leverage market share and economies of scale will drive stronger profits in the future Shipping Market ImplicationsUPS s business has been seeing marginally negative impacts from global economic slowdowns in its international segment  but it was more than made up for with domestic sales  The company has been able to consistently grow its business even in the face of trade conflicts and economic concern but considering that FedEx s earnings covered 2 more months than UPS s could imply negative results in UPS s upcoming Q3 earnings Some of FedEx s issues were company specific  but the impending growth of Amazon s in house logistics and distribution teams is cause for concern for all shipping companies  The global economic slowdown is becoming more pronounced and could hit UPS in its earnings release next month Take AwayThe shipping industry is in crux position as retail is shifting from brick and mortar to online  This creates both an excellent opportunity for growth as well as new competitors like industry behemoth Amazon Currently  analysts are expecting UPS to grow its topline by 3  and 4  for 2019 and 2020 respectively while also improving net margins  FDX is expected to grow its topline by similar figures  but its profitability will decline due to its aggressive price cuts and the ensuing integration costs with TNT Express that seem to have no end Look for UPS s Q3 earnings release in late October to see if the trade war and global economic slowdown are having industry wide effects on shipping operations Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity

397933,SO,5 Oil   Gas Stocks That Could Brave Sector Bloodbath ,opinion,The oil and gas sector has been through several ups and downs in 2018  While oil prices rallied to multi year highs from a decent start this year  natural gas prices picked up pace during the second half of 2018  However  the surge in oil prices was short lived  Natural gas  on the other hand  currently stands at a significantly higher level than its starting point  The movement in prices and the current geopolitical scenario have given investors an idea regarding the future of hydrocarbons  To get a better hold of the future and idea about how to invest in the oil and gas sector  one needs to understand the developments in the space this year  Oil and Gas Prices in 2018 Struggling Oil  WTI crude  the American benchmark  started the year just above  60 per barrel of oil and climbed to a multi year high of  76 41 on Oct 3  primarily due to U S  sanctions on Iran  The drastic fall in Iranian crude exports prior to the sanctions helped to drive oil prices higher  However  several factors including waivers to some heavy oil importing countries  existing oil supply glut and fears that an economic slowdown will dampen the demand outlook led to a sharp fall in oil prices  The OPEC led output cut also failed to boost investor sentiment and crude price  Currently  WTI is trading below the  50 per barrel mark Strength in Natural Gas  Natural gas price traded below  3 per million British thermal units  MMBtu  at the start of the year  which jumped above  4 80 per MMBtu in November  The rise in price level can be attributed to several factors like increasing demand in winter for room heating purposes  replacing coal as the top choice for electricity generation in the United States  rising need for cleaner energy resources  low U S  gas stockpiles  nuclear power plant outages and others  Currently  the Henry Hub natural gas spot price stands at  3 80 per MMBtu It is to be noted that the oil sector has underperformed the S P 500 composite so far this year  The S P 500 saw a decline of 4 5  year to date compared with the oil and gas sector s collective fall of 16 7  What Lies Ahead The supply glut in the oil market is not expected to go any time soon  as a surge in demand in the near future is not prominent  Moreover  the waivers on Iran oil sanctions are likely to continue till April  Per International Energy Agency  IEA   global surplus in the fourth quarter will touch 0 7 million barrels per day  MMBbls d   Moreover  the surplus could rise to 2 MMBbls d in the first half of 2019  IEA added  The bearish global demand outlook further dampens investor sentiment  Hence  an immediate rise in crude prices is not on the horizon Meanwhile  natural gas production is expected to continue increasing in the coming days  per Energy Information Administration  EIA   The agency anticipates output to increase 11  this year to record levels  This will likely lead to lower natural gas prices  Per EIA  Henry Hub natural gas spot price in 2019 is expected to average  2 98 per MMBtu  lower than current year s expected average of  3 01 per MMBtu In short  the oil and gas sector is

414624,DD,5 DuPont Tested Stocks For Promising Returns,opinion,Return on equity  ROE  is one of the top metrics on investors  mind when they set out to select stocks  and quite rightly so  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings of a company from its equity However  delving into the basics of ROE and analyzing it at a deeper level  with the help of DuPont  NYSE DD  analysis  could lead to better returns  It is an analytical method  which critically examines three major elements   operating management  management of assets and the capital structure   related to the financial condition of a company  It s basically taking ROE apart to examine how it works  Although it can be presented in several ways  the most popular one is shown below ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierWhy DuPont The importance of ROE can t be emphasized enough but still it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis allows investors to assess which of the elements is dominant in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies with high margins from those with high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover In fact  it also sheds light on a company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  ROE of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt burden So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective will be at a loss if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  DuPont analysis comes to the rescue and finds out the better stock  Thus  a company with a healthy mix of all the three metrics   profit margin  asset turnover ratio and equity multiplier   will be the most alluring DuPont analysis is not difficult  as the required numbers are available in a company s income statement and balance sheet However  looking at the financial statements of each and every company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can easily shortlist the stocks that look impressive based on a DuPont analysis Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or

250995,CAJ,Tokyo business executives fear bearish Year of Ox,news,"TOKYO  Jan 6  Reuters    Japan s top businessmen toasted the
new year at a party on Tuesday  but the mood was bleak as the
world s No 2 economy hunkers down for a bearish Year of the Ox 
 A languishing stock market and the dismal outlook for
exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp made for dour banter among
bankers and chief executives  who bowed and toasted each other at
the annual gathering of Japan s biggest business lobby 
  I never expected the crisis to spread this fast  and leave
this deep a scar   Toyota President Katsuaki Watanabe said on the
sidelines of the party  just hours after his firm reported a 37
percent slide in U S  car sales in December and said it would
halt production at some plants 
  If you look at the automobile market now  it s very  very
tough  We need to proceed with the assumption that this situation
could continue  
 Other exporters such as Honda Motor and Canon Inc have also
been waylaid by a surge in the yen  which threatens to decimate
profits from overseas sales 
  A rapid strengthening of the yen brings major damage to
Japan s economy   said Fujio Mitarai  the chairman of Canon and
Nippon Keidanren  the main lobby group for big firms whose
exports drive the Japanese economy 
 Mitarai told a news conference following the party that he
hoped the dollar would average 95 105 yen this year  after it
slumped to a 13 year low against the yen last month near 87 yen 
 In Japan  which follows the Chinese zodiac  2009 is the Year
of the Ox  Research company Daiwa Institute has said that  Ox 
years have previously been rough ones for Japanese stocks 
 If true  that portends a disastrous year for Tokyo equities 
as the the Tokyo stock market already booked its worst year on
record in 2008

434709,WMB,Key Takeaways From Trump s State of the Union Speech,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump  on the eve of his likely acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial  delivered his third State of the Union address    and added to the drama with a handful of stage managed surprises 
His 78 minute remarks to a Congress never mentioned the word impeachment yet partisanship loomed over his visit on Tuesday to Capitol Hill  Republicans chanted  four more years  after the president was introduced at the podium and a swath of Democratic women were dressed in all white to honor suffragettes 
The State of the Union offered Trump the chance to address the country after a tumultuous start to 2020  marked by conflict in the Middle East  fears over a rapidly spreading virus and new trade deals with Mexico and China  Here are the key takeaways 
Betting on the Economy
Trump spent the first half hour of the speech lauding his record on the economy  calling it the  best it s ever been  and pointing to a  blue collar boom  in a sign of how much he ll lean on the issue heading into the November election 
He rattled off a series of robust job market stats  unemployment rates for blacks  Hispanic Americans and women have all hit record or near record lows during his presidency 
Left unsaid was that those achievements are largely a function of a tight labor market and an economic expansion now in its record 11th year  Cracks remain  wage growth has slowed  the participation rate    the share of the working population employed or looking for work    still hasn t recovered its pre recession level and the nation s overall income inequality is widening 
As for the manufacturing sector  factories are planning investment cuts this year for the first time since 2009 and jobs added to the sector have slowed  in fact  declining in December  
Hyper Partisanship
Every State of the Union is a partisan affair  but with the impeachment trial and Democratic primaries taking place  the divide between the parties was stark  The president spent nearly the entirety of his speech turned to his left    to face friendlier Republicans    while Democrats largely stayed seated 
As Trump made his points  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi frequently looked down and flipped through a copy of the president s speech  gazed at her colleagues on the right side of the chamber and seemed astonished when Trump cited policy achievements    such as criminal justice reform    that only passed because of Democratic support 
Without looking their way  Trump criticized the  one hundred thirty two lawmakers in this room  who  have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our health care system   He said another 130 Democrats would  bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer funded health care to millions  of undocumented migrants 
But Pelosi got the final say  As the president finished his speech  she picked up her copy of his remarks and tore it in half 
Limbaugh s Medal of Freedom
Trump delighted Republicans    and horrified Democrats    with the revelation that he was awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh  who disclosed on his radio show Monday that he had advanced lung cancer 
The decision  unusual for a State of the Union  seemed to catch Limbaugh off guard  He appeared astonished as Trump made the announcement and First Lady Melania Trump put the blue ribboned medal around his neck 
 He is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet   Trump said of Limbaugh   Rush Limbaugh  Thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country  
Limbaugh  an ardent Trump supporter  has frequently courted controversy  He gave fuel to Trump s debunked conspiracy that former President Barack Obama wasn t born in the U S  Limbaugh also lost many advertisers in 2012 after denigrating law student Sandra Fluke for speaking out about birth control 
Drug Prices
Trump demanded that Congress pass legislation that lowers prescription drug prices    one of the few issues where Republicans and Democrats say they re willing to collaborate ahead of the November elections 
 I have been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done  and done properly   Trump said   Get a bill to my desk  and I will sign it into law without delay  
An obstacle could be one Trump s key allies in Congress    Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell    who has resisted bringing up bills opposed by the pharmaceutical industry  Despite McConnell s stance  Grassley  a Republican  has said he would work to advance legislation he s written with Senator Ron Wyden  an Oregon Democrat 
Members of both parties say lowering drug prices is a priority  and various proposals have been circulating in Congress  The Democratic led House passed a bill last year that would enable Medicare to negotiate drug prices but it hasn t been taken up in the Senate  Many Democrats stood up in the House chamber and shouted the bill number  HR 3  at Trump as he implored them to send him legislation 
Reality Show Speech
In a nod to his reality show past  Trump sprinkled emotional surprises and giveaways into the now common use of civilian guests in the House gallery  To highlight his point about school choice  the president announced that Janiyah Davis  a fourth grader from Philadelphia sitting with her mother  would be receiving a scholarship to attend the school of her choice 
After singling out an eighth grade student from Arizona who Trump said dreams of joining the new Space Force  the president recognized the boy s great grandfather  Charles McGee  a 100 year old World War II veteran  McGee  who was in the chamber after taking part in Sunday s Super Bowl festivities  was promoted to brigadier general and had his stars pinned on his uniform by the president earlier Tuesday 
In perhaps the most emotional moment of the night  Trump acknowledged Amy Williams  NYSE WMB   whose husband Townsend was in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment  After saying that Amy s two children had  not seen their father s face in many months   Trump announced that her husband was actually in the chamber  Townsend walked down the steps toward her seat  hugged their children  and was reunited with his family 
Tough Talk on Mideast  Venezuela
While Trump touted his efforts to push back Islamic State and kill its leader  Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi  his claims to have wiped out the terror group contradicted military officials  The Defense Intelligence Agency  for instance  has told the Pentagon s Inspector General that Islamic State exploited the withdrawal plans of U S  troops from Syria to  reconstitute  
The president campaigned in 2016 on pulling the U S  out of the Middle East s  endless wars     a theme he repeated on Tuesday    but since May he has sent more than 15 000 troops to the region as part of his campaign to pressure Iran 
Trump again said he wants to end the almost 19 year old war in Afghanistan  but his chief envoy to peace talks said this week that the situation in Afghanistan is complicated and may not lend itself to an easy end 
Referencing another foreign policy hotspot  one of Trump s special guests in the audience was Juan Guaido  the opposition leader whom the U S  has recognized as Venezuela s legitimate leader more than a year ago 
Inviting Guaido    whom Trump referred to as  Mr  President     was clearly meant to give a shot of momentum to the Venezuelan opposition parties that have been unable to oust President Nicolas Maduro 
 Maduro is an illegitimate ruler  a tyrant who brutalizes his people   Trump said   But Maduro s grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken  ",2020-02-05,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/key-takeaways-from-trumps-state-of-the-union-speech-2076287,2076287
